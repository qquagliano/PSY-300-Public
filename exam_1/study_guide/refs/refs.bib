  abstract = {"Featuring an emphasis on future consumers of psychological research and examples drawn from popular media, Research Methods: Evaluating Psychology in the Real World 4e develops students' critical-thinking skills as they evaluate information in their everyday lives. The Fourth Edition of this dominant text takes learning to a new level for both consumers and producers by offering new content, interactive learning, and online assessment to help them master the concepts. Most chapters will be familiar to veteran instructors, including chapters on measurement, experimentation, and factorial designs. However, unlike some methods books, this one devotes two full chapters to correlational research (one on bivariate and one on multivariate studies), which help students learn how to interpret, apply, and interrogate different types of association claims, one of the common types of claims they will encounter. There are three supplementary chapters on descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, and scientific writing (APA-Style reports and posters). These chapters provide a review for students who have already had statistics and provide the tools they need to create research reports and conference posters. The appendices provide statistical tables for students who are conducting their own research"-- Provided by publisher},
