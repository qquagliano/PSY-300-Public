# Learning Objectives

## Learning Objectives

### Professor's Objectives

- Understand the concept of APA style and why it is important to use in
scientific writing

- Comprehend the individual parts of an APA style citation, in both publications
(articles) and presentations

- Be able to write a full APA citation (like that found in the 'References'
section of a paper) with correct formatting for articles and presentations

- Be able to write in-text citations with proper formatting and placement, both
in parenthetical and prose formats.

# Why APA Style?

## Overview

- There are many different style and citation guides out there:
  - Chicago, MLA, APA, etc.

- The guides and styles cover many aspects of writing:
  - Grammar and punctuation practices
  - Reporting in tables and plots
  - Fonts, Margins, etc.
  - Citations and references
  - And many other components

- These different styles are recommended by different organizations and
institution, and are often adopted by different fields as the de facto standards
  - MLA -> Humanities, Literature, etc.
  - APA -> STEM, etc.

- Usually, these recommended styles are also adopted by the journals within a
field (though there are exceptions)

## APA Style

- APA style is defined by and named after the American Psychological Association
(also abbreviated as APA). It is currently in its 7th edition.
  - DO NOT use APA 6th edition or any other prior editions, as they do differ in
  their style.

- APA style governs pretty much all types of academic writing in psychological
research, but is also found in other fields, like sociology as well. It is
widely-accepted as a valid way to structure reports, papers, and presentations

- We will not cover every single recommendation made by the manual, as some
content is more related to general writing or statistical reporting (which will
be more relevant in the PSY-350 course)

- Of most concern to this course is understanding *how* and *where* to use
in-text citations, and how to properly report the full citations in a references
section

# Why Cite?

## Where Do We Get Evidence From?

- As discussed in chapter 1 of the textbook, and expanded on in chapter 2,
scientists use journals as an outlet for reporting (hopefully) valid and
important findings from producing research

- These publications are the source that we should pull knowledge from, in order
to craft theories, build arguments, and rationale our research and design goals.
  - Presentations and posters may also be used, but preferably to a lesser
  extent

- The value of using these sources will be further expanded in next week's
lecture and chapter reading

## Citing from the Literature

- When we need to use evidence from a previous study, we must make proper
reference to the literature - so that we properly attribute a finding and idea
to its source.

- Common practice is to make a short, in-text citation somewhere near the
relevant statement, and then, report the full citation information at the end of
a paper, in the "References" section.
  - This links the idea with its origin, and provides ample credit where it is
  due

- Using citations actually helps *strengthen* our arguments as we add the weight
of evidence to support our conclusions and ideas

- APA has specific guidelines for how each of these components should be written

## An Example

"The Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM) has been shown to be an appropriate
measure of performance validity in various clinical subgroups, such as
individuals with TBI, people with severe depression symptoms, and those with
dementia. Therefore, it is appropriate for use in the present study."

**Pair and Share:** Discuss what parts of this may need a citation added? What
are the implications for not having any sources for this?

# Ideal Citation Examples

## Publications / Journal Articles

### In-text

Berrill et al. (2023) or (Berrill et al., 2023) or, if there were only two
authors, Berrill & Quagliano (2023)

### In References

@berrill_performance_2023

### Notes

- In text can be used in natural writing (first option) or in a
fully-parenthetical form (second option), which is commonly used at the end of a
statement or sentence.

- Note the italicizing (and lack thereof) in certain parts

## Presentations / Posters

### In-text

Qureshi et al. (2024) or (Qureshi et al., 2024)

### In References

@qureshi_use_2024

### Notes

- In text citation styles are the same as with papers

- Notice the difference in italicization - it is now on the title, instead of
the journal name

- Remember that these are usually non-preferred to article citations
