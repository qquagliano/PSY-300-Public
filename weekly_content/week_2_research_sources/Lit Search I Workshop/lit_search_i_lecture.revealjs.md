# Learning Objectives

## Professor's Objectives

- Be able to locate scientific journal articles on a specific topic, within a
certain time frame of publication

- Accurately identify an article as an original, empirical article, literature
review, or meta-analysis

- Successfully discriminate between peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed sources

- Acquire full-text PDFs of selected journal articles for further reading

# Getting Started

## Launching Point

- Beginning any sort of literature review can be overwhelming (even for me). You
need to know your available resources to best start your search.

- Whenever you are attached to an institution (e.g., university, hospital), you
are likely to have access to many great guides, journals, and search engines

- For example, the GVSU library publishes a [Psychology Research
Guide](https://libguides.gvsu.edu/psych), which is an excellent place to get
started for all things research

- Wren Pierce is the library liaison for psychology stuff, you should definitely
[email her](mailto:piercel1@gvsu.edu) if you want more help looking for
things!

## Reputable Databases

*The following information is readily found in the previously mentioned GVSU
psychology research guide*

- The first problem you have when looking for literature - where can I search?
  - Traditional search engines (e.g., Google, Bing, etc.) are likely to return
  unpublished and unhelpful results - I really wouldn't recommend these.
  - When looking for scholarly articles, you should rely on provided databases
  that will search many scientific journals to find peer-reviewed publications.

- You should first use a [list of library-recommended
databases for psychology](https://libguides.gvsu.edu/c.php?g=108342&p=702876).

- If you need to look even more broad, such as for topics that may fall under a
different discipline, see the [full list of library
databases](https://libguides.gvsu.edu/az.php).

- If you need full books on psychology topics, take a look at this [book list
for psychology](https://libguides.gvsu.edu/c.php?g=108342&p=702937) that tells
you where to start looking

## Google Scholar and Other Alternative Search Sites

- [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) is an alternative google search
engine that only looks at scientific writing
  - *However*, I find that it has a tendency to return non-published pre-prints,
  presentations, and dubious articles that may be from predatory journals
  - It also doesn't do an excellent job with finding very specific topics
  - I would strongly recommend you prefer those prior databases

- [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/) is another site for finding
research, but suffers from similar problems as Google Scholar

# Navigating the Literature Search

## Database Search Practice

- I'll be showing everyone how to do searching, but I encourage you to follow
along on your own devices for practice!

- This will be an essential skill for your later, major take-home assignments
and your success in this will be vital for your references and introduction
sections.

## Citing the Articles

- Look for a "Cite" button on whatever website you are on, make sure you are
using APA 7th Edition, and choose "plain text" for a citation you can paste into
your references.

- Google Scholar shortcut for citations (but double-check!!)

- Citation management software - the best! But a bit more complicated
