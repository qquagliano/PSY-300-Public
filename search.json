    "text": "Introduction\nA thorough literature review establishing context for your planned study. You should use vetted, peer-reviewed sources that add support to the topic you choose as a valuable and meaningful area of investigation. Scaffold naturally from foundation concepts in the research area to the “gap” that you are trying to fill with the proposal. Effectively, you are making an argument for why this research is needed and providing the necessary information for a reader to understand your starting point. You will also need to write a clear hypothesis that articulates the goal of the study and expected outcome."

You should also reasonably address each area of validity we have discussed in class and the impact of design decisions on the strength and generalizability of claims. Where necessary, consider citing previous work in the area with similar methodology that buttresses your approach. Give detail on the scale of measurement, and rationale your use of particular statistical tests that are appropriate for these tests. (Do not worry too much about in-depth statistical procedures, that will be covered further in future course - but it will help to get familiar sooner)"

Properly tracking and integrating sources is one of the most difficult parts about planning research, so please put good time into reading and evaluating articles for inclusion in your final project.\nIt is to your advantage to finish as much of your proposal as you can before this deadline, as I can give more feedback, and it will set you up better for an easier final submission.

    "text": "7.3 Reliability and Validity in Observation Data\n\nConstruct validity in observational data can be confounded by 3 types of biases: observer bias, observer effects, and reactivity.\n\nObserver Bias\n\nDepending on the circumstances, observers may be bias to “see” a certain result in participants due to some preconceived notions or beliefs\nThis is why it is important to have observers blind to the study they may be observing and to have rigorous training that helps ensure a smooth and consistent process (double-checked with reliability analysis! - but what type…)\n\nIt is common to use codebooks to clearly highlight how a variable or behavior is to be defined for a particular study.\n\nBlinded studies may also be called “masked studies”.\n\nObserver Effects\n\nObserver effects are when participants act un-natural in response to the behaviors or perspectives of the researchers. Participants may readily act a certain way to appear “good” or they may be intentionally careful or stiff or modify actions as they watch how experiments react.\nParticipants may also be unintentionally reacting to the behaviors of the observers as well!\nThe same solutions can help, especially blinding the observers, because they won’t be unconsciously swayed by their knowledge.\n\nReactivity\n\nReactivity is somewhat similar to Observer effects, but hinges on the mere presence of the observer causing behavior changes in the participant.\nThe book proposes three solutions to minimize reactive behaviors\nFind some way to be “unobtrusive” in observation, whether viewing from afar or outside the view of the subject\nAllow a subject to acclimate to having you there and let any initial reactivity die out\nMeasure residual results of the behavior once the subject themself is gone - but this is still observational\n\nEthics in Observation\n\nLike any procedures planned for research, observation techniques and tools need to be approached in an ethical and sensible manner, with informed consent/debrief telling participants how and why their data is used\nSome deception, such as watching through a one-way mirror may be permissible (if allowed by the IRB), as long as it has good, scientific rationale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nChapter 6 Lecture - Surveys and Observational Desgins || PSY-300: Research Methods in Psychology"

    "text": "7.3 Reliability and Validity in Observation Data\n\nConstruct validity in observational data can be confounded by 3 types of biases: observer bias, observer effects, and reactivity.\n\nObserver Bias\n\nDepending on the circumstances, observers may be bias to “see” a certain result in participants due to some preconceived notions or beliefs\nThis is why it is important to have observers blind to the study they may be observing and to have rigorous training that helps ensure a smooth and consistent process (double-checked with reliability analysis! - but what type…)\n\nIt is common to use codebooks to clearly highlight how a variable or behavior is to be defined for a particular study.\n\nBlinded studies may also be called “masked studies”.\n\nObserver Effects\n\nObserver effects are when participants act un-natural in response to the behaviors or perspectives of the researchers. Participants may readily act a certain way to appear “good” or they may be intentionally careful or stiff or modify actions as they watch how experiments react.\nParticipants may also be unintentionally reacting to the behaviors of the observers as well!\nThe same solutions can help, especially blinding the observers, because they won’t be unconsciously swayed by their knowledge.\n\nReactivity\n\nReactivity is somewhat similar to Observer effects, but hinges on the mere presence of the observer causing behavior changes in the participant.\nThe book proposes three solutions to minimize reactive behaviors\nFind some way to be “unobtrusive” in observation, whether viewing from afar or outside the view of the subject\nAllow a subject to acclimate to having you there and let any initial reactivity die out\nMeasure residual results of the behavior once the subject themself is gone - but this is still observational\n\nEthics in Observation\n\nLike any procedures planned for research, observation techniques and tools need to be approached in an ethical and sensible manner, with informed consent/debrief telling participants how and why their data is used\nSome deception, such as watching through a one-way mirror may be permissible (if allowed by the IRB), as long as it has good, scientific rationale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nChapter 6 Lecture - Surveys and Observational Desgins || PSY-300: Research Methods in Psychology"

In the case of this article, I specifically commented that the graphs gave an excellent visual aid to understand the tightly clustered nature of the different conditions.\nWhenever you are looking for something related to internal validity, we are often going to be focused on words like “confounds”, “mediators”, “moderator”, “cause” - because that validity is focused on the like between the manipulated (experimental) and the measured (outcome) variables\nA randomized controlled trial (RCT) is a clinical research design term that is, effectively, a type of experiment - which IS a valid design for investigating causal claims. The “randomized” refers to random assignment (a critical part of experiments) and the “controlled” alludes to the tight control for confounds that experiments should have.\n\nRe: this statement: “Among patients who have suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI), most patients see a logarithmic return of cognitive skills post-injury”\n\nThis is a frequency claim, which is indicated by the word “most”. I am saying that a greater proportion of people have this trend of recovery.\n\nRe: this statement: “Time (in seconds) to complete a 100 m dash”\n\nWill be a continuous/interval/ratio type data, as it has a clear, consistent, known distance between points - we know how long is in between two seconds. That alone makes it continuous in nature. It is not ordinal, because that would imply we don’t know the distance between two values in the scale."

For example:\n\nA chemist is able to measure parts of solutions with pH, graduated cylinders, etc.\nPhysicists can measure weight, mass, speed, velocity with time and scales\nBiologists can measure numbers of animals or number of times a certain trait appears in a creature\nIn psychology, we cannot directly measure cognitive traits that are internal to people, and even in behaviors things may be complicated…\n\nRemember that construct validity: we must make operational variables from latent/conceptual/construct variables, and we must do this well!"

The type we will be talking about now is technically called Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient \\(r\\).\n\\(r\\) will always be between -1 and 1, with 0 representing no correlation or relationship and -1/1 representing a perfectly strong relationship between the two. In practice, you will never get exactly 0 or -1/1, but likely some number in between.\n\n\\[\nr=\\frac{\\sum{(x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}}{\\sqrt{\\sum{(x_i -\n\\bar{x})^2}\\sum{(y_i - \\bar{y})^2}}}\n\\]\n\nThis correlation coefficient is technically only applicable to continuous data, but is generalizable to ordinal data by using Spearman’s \\(\\rho\\) (rho) or Kendall’s \\(\\tau-B\\) (tau-B).\n\nPerfect Positive Relationship\n\n\nR Code\ncor(test_1_perf, test_2_perf)\n\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nImperfect Positive Relationship\n\n\nR Code\ncor(test_1_imperf, test_2_imperf)\n\n\n[1] 0.9944883\n\n\n\nThe interpretation process is fairly straightforward for inter-rater or test-retest reliability -&gt; higher \\(r\\) = greater consistency/reliability.\nAnother popular statistic for inter-rater reliability is called Cohen’s \\(\\kappa\\) (kappa), but that is only applicable when raters are grouping objects or people. It’s interpretation is the same as \\(r\\).\n\nInternal Reliability\n\nThe simplest way to arrange this is to use a correlation matrix of all the items of a measure, and calculate the \\(r\\) between each two items. See table 5.3 on in your book (pg 311) as an example.\nIn such a table, we are looking to make sure construct-related items are positive, highly correlated and that theoretical unrelated items are negative or weakly correlated.\nYou may also calculate an average inter-item correlation which is just an average correlation across the entire matrix (only recommended if all items should be related)\n\nSide note: I wouldn’t recommend using the acronym AIC for this - most statisticians use that more often for the Akaike information criterion, used often in regression\nWe want roughly between 0.15 and 0.50 for this to be “reliable”\n\nFinally, you can take Cronbach’s \\(\\alpha\\) (alpha) which is taken from the average inter-item correlation and number of items on a scale.\n\nThis is probably the “preferred” statistic for internal reliability\nAbove 0.80 is good for self-reports, we want as close to 1 as possible"

However, they are a little superficial and tend to be more valued when a measurement scale is first proposed, vs. less so when a scale is more established.\nFace validity is largely just an assessment of “well, does it seem like this would work” - may be evaluated by the general public or by experts in a domain\nContent validity asks whether it appears a measurement would capture all components of a theoretical construct. This is usually best assessed by domain experts which have a strong knowledge of the theory underlying a certain construct.\nFor a more empirical, albeit subjective approach, some studies will gather a panel of experts, calculating \\(r\\) or \\(\\kappa\\) for a measurement or the individual items of a measure across the experts. This could be taken as evidence of somewhat decent expert consensus on a tool, but it strays close to an appeal to authority (i.e., the expertise of the judges). For more than 2 judges we would use extensions of those statistics that are applicable to multivariate data (e.g., multivariate regression, G-study, D-study, etc.)"

    "text": "8.4 Criterion Validity\n\nCriterion validity focuses on whether a measurement is positively associated with behaviors that are also said to be representative of the construct. Now those selected behaviors are also a subjective choice - but this measurement validity can help establish that a measure is related to what behaviors we normally associate with a trait.\n\nCorrelative Methods (for Continuous Behavior)\n\nOnce again, we are able to use correlative methods and scatterplots, like those previous discussed.\n\nIn the scatterplot, we would place the number or magnitude of behavior on one axis and the measure on the other axis.\nA strong, positive relationship between the two would be indicative of good criterion validity\n\nFor example, consider we are developing a collateral-report measure for temper in children where a parent reports how often a child engages in disruptive behavior. Now, we sit in a classroom with the child and measure the number of times they engage in disruptive behavior. A higher score on the measure should be associated with a higher number of occurrences of disruptive behavior.\n\nKnown Groups Methods (for Categorical Behavior Groups)\n\nWe can also assess whether a measure is able to discern differences between some known-groups by some established standard.\n\nThis means that, prior to testing the new measure, we must have some “source of truth” for whether a person belongs to a certain group.\n\nExample: We have two groups of people, those diagnosed with schizophrenia and those not diagnosed with schizophrenia. We have a continuous measure designed to detect psychotic disorders. Are those individuals with schizophrenia and those without scoring different on this measure?\nIn this method, we could use between-groups statistics, such as t-tests and ANOVA to decide whether scores on the measure are significantly different between the known-group members.\n\nIn modern research, you are more likely to see techniques like logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), and area-under-the-curve (AUC) analysis - as these methods are able to detect appropriate “cut-off” scores for the measure that discriminate between the two groups with ideal sensitivity (detection of true positives) and specificity (detection of true negatives)"

In the case of this article, I specifically commented that the graphs gave an excellent visual aid to understand the tightly clustered nature of the different conditions.\nWhenever you are looking for something related to internal validity, we are often going to be focused on words like “confounds”, “mediators”, “moderator”, “cause” - because that validity is focused on the like between the manipulated (experimental) and the measured (outcome) variables\nA randomized controlled trial (RCT) is a clinical research design term that is, effectively, a type of experiment - which IS a valid design for investigating causal claims. The “randomized” refers to random assignment (a critical part of experiments) and the “controlled” alludes to the tight control for confounds that experiments should have.\n\nRe: this statement: “Among patients who have suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI), most patients see a logarithmic return of cognitive skills post-injury”\n\nThis is a frequency claim, which is indicated by the word “most”. I am saying that a greater proportion of people have this trend of recovery.\n\nRe: this statement: “Time (in seconds) to complete a 100 m dash”\n\nWill be a continuous/interval/ratio type data, as it has a clear, consistent, known distance between points - we know how long is in between two seconds.

We would call that self-reported information\nThis can be either through a paper form or through a verbal questionnaire\nRelated: in some cases we may use what is called a collateral report which involves a third-party (e.g., parent, teacher, friend) providing their perception of another person\n\nObservational\n\nThis is derived from a third party observing a person’s behavior/actions and recording how many times a certain behavior occurs.\nWhat I do every day in clinic is technically an observational measure: I present a person with some task or stimuli and I observe their response or success on a test\n\nPhysiological\n\nThis is some sort of measurement of physical characteristics of a person, tends to be much more of a “concrete” measurement that than other two described\nA lot of physiological measures enjoy some associations with the types of measures above\n\nFor example: a person who reports a high level of anxiety may also show a specific pattern of activation in the brain during an fMRI\n\nExamples:\n\nBrain scans: CT, MRI, fMRI, PET, EEG\nFacial movement: EMG\n\nIdeally, we may choose to use all 3 types of measures or some combination of two of them, to provide multiple operationalizations for the same construct, and they should all be associated (correlated) with one another."

    "text": "7.4 Correlation Coefficient\n\nTo mathematically calculate the direction and strength of relationship between two variables we may use \\(r\\). The type we will be talking about now is technically called Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient \\(r\\).\n\\(r\\) will always be between -1 and 1, with 0 representing no correlation or relationship and -1/1 representing a perfectly strong relationship between the two. In practice, you will never get exactly 0 or -1/1, but likely some number in between.\n\n\\[\nr=\\frac{\\sum{(x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}}{\\sqrt{\\sum{(x_i -\n\\bar{x})^2}\\sum{(y_i - \\bar{y})^2}}}\n\\]\n\nThis correlation coefficient is technically only applicable to continuous data, but is generalizable to ordinal data by using Spearman’s \\(\\rho\\) (rho) or Kendall’s \\(\\tau-B\\) (tau-B).\n\nPerfect Positive Relationship\n\n\nR Code\ncor(test_1_perf, test_2_perf)\n\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nImperfect Positive Relationship\n\n\nR Code\ncor(test_1_imperf, test_2_imperf)\n\n\n[1] 0.9944883\n\n\n\nThe interpretation process is fairly straightforward for inter-rater or test-retest reliability -&gt; higher \\(r\\) = greater consistency/reliability.\nAnother popular statistic for inter-rater reliability is called Cohen’s \\(\\kappa\\) (kappa), but that is only applicable when raters are grouping objects or people. It’s interpretation is the same as \\(r\\).\n\nInternal Reliability\n\nThe simplest way to arrange this is to use a correlation matrix of all the items of a measure, and calculate the \\(r\\) between each two items. See table 5.3 on in your book (pg 311) as an example.\nIn such a table, we are looking to make sure construct-related items are positive, highly correlated and that theoretical unrelated items are negative or weakly correlated.\nYou may also calculate an average inter-item correlation which is just an average correlation across the entire matrix (only recommended if all items should be related)\n\nSide note: I wouldn’t recommend using the acronym AIC for this - most statisticians use that more often for the Akaike information criterion, used often in regression\nWe want roughly between 0.15 and 0.50 for this to be “reliable”\n\nFinally, you can take Cronbach’s \\(\\alpha\\) (alpha) which is taken from the average inter-item correlation and number of items on a scale.\n\nThis is probably the “preferred” statistic for internal reliability\nAbove 0.80 is good for self-reports, we want as close to 1 as possible"

However, they are a little superficial and tend to be more valued when a measurement scale is first proposed, vs. less so when a scale is more established.\nFace validity is largely just an assessment of “well, does it seem like this would work” - may be evaluated by the general public or by experts in a domain\nContent validity asks whether it appears a measurement would capture all components of a theoretical construct. This is usually best assessed by domain experts which have a strong knowledge of the theory underlying a certain construct.\nFor a more empirical, albeit subjective approach, some studies will gather a panel of experts, calculating \\(r\\) or \\(\\kappa\\) for a measurement or the individual items of a measure across the experts. This could be taken as evidence of somewhat decent expert consensus on a tool, but it strays close to an appeal to authority (i.e., the expertise of the judges). For more than 2 judges we would use extensions of those statistics that are applicable to multivariate data (e.g., multivariate regression, G-study, D-study, etc.)"

    "text": "8.4 Criterion Validity\n\nCriterion validity focuses on whether a measurement is positively associated with behaviors that are also said to be representative of the construct. Now those selected behaviors are also a subjective choice - but this measurement validity can help establish that a measure is related to what behaviors we normally associate with a trait.\n\nCorrelative Methods (for Continuous Behavior)\n\nOnce again, we are able to use correlative methods and scatterplots, like those previous discussed.\n\nIn the scatterplot, we would place the number or magnitude of behavior on one axis and the measure on the other axis.\nA strong, positive relationship between the two would be indicative of good criterion validity\n\nFor example, consider we are developing a collateral-report measure for temper in children where a parent reports how often a child engages in disruptive behavior. Now, we sit in a classroom with the child and measure the number of times they engage in disruptive behavior. A higher score on the measure should be associated with a higher number of occurrences of disruptive behavior.\n\nKnown Groups Methods (for Categorical Behavior Groups)\n\nWe can also assess whether a measure is able to discern differences between some known-groups by some established standard.\n\nThis means that, prior to testing the new measure, we must have some “source of truth” for whether a person belongs to a certain group.\n\nExample: We have two groups of people, those diagnosed with schizophrenia and those not diagnosed with schizophrenia. We have a continuous measure designed to detect psychotic disorders. Are those individuals with schizophrenia and those without scoring different on this measure?\nIn this method, we could use between-groups statistics, such as t-tests and ANOVA to decide whether scores on the measure are significantly different between the known-group members.\n\nIn modern research, you are more likely to see techniques like logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), and area-under-the-curve (AUC) analysis - as these methods are able to detect appropriate “cut-off” scores for the measure that discriminate between the two groups with ideal sensitivity (detection of true positives) and specificity (detection of true negatives)"

I am interested in a population of GV students, so I put every ID number in a list and then have a computer pick one at random.\n\nEach person has a \\(1/n\\) chance to be selected, where \\(n\\) is the number of people in the population\n\nFantastic generalizability, but very difficult and rare\n\n\n\nSystematic\n\nReturn to our population of GV students: select two random numbers, say \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n\\(a\\) will be our \\(a^{th}\\) person in the list of IDs.\n\\(b\\) will be the number of people we increment by\nWe start with the \\(a^{th}\\) person, and then sample each person \\(b\\) away from that person\n\nSay we have \\(a = 4\\) and \\(b = 8\\), we would sample the 4th student, then the 12th, then the 20th, etc.\nStill results in a pretty good sample comparable to simple random!\n\n\n\nCluster\n\nThis method comes in when we have naturally existing cluster within our population of interest\n\nFrom the book example: high school students organized into high schools\n\nWe randomly sample from the clusters (e.g., the high school) and then sample all students within a cluster\nStill pretty good!\n\n\n\nMultistage\n\nSimply, cluster random sampling followed by simple random within the selected clusters.\nAlso, good!\n\n\n\nStratified\n\nThis is a method that is done when we are trying to ensure that our sample is representative of proportions of natural strata in the population.\nStrata must be some meaningful grouping variable (e.g., different ethnicities, different genders, different education levels, etc.) with known levels within the population.\n\nE.g., class level (First-year, sophomore, junior, senior) at GVSU\n\nAfter we have our stratifying variable, we then randomly sample within each level of the variable.\nHowever, our goal is to get a sample with equal proportions of the strata to the population\n\nE.g., If GVSU has 30% First-year, 20% Sophomore, 25% Junior, and 25% senior, I want my sample to have that same breakdown!\n\n\n\n\nOversampling\n\nThis is a modified stratified sampling, where we intentionally represent one or more levels of the strata more in sample, than is found in the population\nThis is used when we may want to ensure that we still capture the experience of a relatively small group of individuals.\nA related concept for a similar goal is weighting where an unbalanced sample (across some strata) has occurred and we use a statistical technique to give more “value” or weight to less-represented groups.\n\n\n\nRandomness in Sampling and Assignment\n\nRandom sampling is related to external validity and how we initially draw our sample from the broader population of people\nRandom assignment is when we already have our sample and are sorting people into different levels of a manipulated/experimental variable, much more related to experiments and internal validity."

Instead, its historical significance is that of being the catalyst for a massive research ethics overhaul in the United States, due to its numerous negligent procedures.\nThe study proceeded in intentional secrecy, deceiving both its participants, and the broader American public. The researchers ignored well-founded concerns from whistleblowers and failed to respect the autonomy and well-being of its participants.\n\n\n\n\nThough this was a medical study, the downstream effects and lessons learned from this study are immediately relevant to psychology and all social science research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLessons learned:\n\nParticipants were not treated with respect, autonomy, and dignity. They were deceived, intentionally un-informed of risks and treatments, prevented from finding information that would aid them in making decision about study participation\nParticipants were intimately and immensely harmed. They were allowed to suffer with the effects of the disease, despite the development of valid treatments that would have cured the disease. The study prioritized the possible results over the safety of its participants.\nParticipants were purposefully sampled as members of a vulnerable and oppressed socioeconomic group. The Black men in this study were likely to be poor and have little formal education. Rather than take measures to respect and inform each participant, this was exploited to keep participants unaware."

    "text": "Milgram’s Obedience Studies\n\nIn summary, Stanley Milgram’s experiments (which came in many variations) were focused on examining how people respond to authoritative commands to inflict punishment and follow orders. These experiments were, in part, born out of questions surrounding obedience of citizens and soldiers in the Nazi regime, in Germany.\n\n\n\n\nParticipants often would have some role in inflicting a perceived pain or punishment on to an actor. No actual harm was actually inflicted to the actor (a confederate), but participants did believe that they were inflicting the pain, usually a shock of some degree. If they pushed back against the demand to administer the punishment (even at extreme levels), an authoritative figure would instruct them to continue over and over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, the flaw does not lie in harm done to the actor - the shocks weren’t real, and were merely simulated. However, think about the emotional distress in the participants - feeling “forced” by authority to perform inhumane actions.\nThough participants were debriefed at the end of the study and met the actor who assured they were fine - there are questions as to whether they were truly told that those shocks were faked. Some participants worried for weeks.\n\n\n\nLessons learned:\n\nMilgram continued the studies, even after learning a staggering 65% of participants would continue the shocks to the end - usually accompanied by extreme emotional distress of the participants.\nWhile the Tuskegee study showed us physical harm to the participants, this study showed us emotional pain inflicted on the participants. Both are reasonable dangers we must consider in psychological research.\nWas it worth it? Did we learn something so valuable that made it worth the pain those people felt…"

    "section": "The Belmont Report",
    "text": "The Belmont Report\n\nOverview\n\nIn many ways, the Belmont Report is the original and most influential guiding pieces of ethical conduct for any type of human subjects research in the United States.\nThough it is very comprehensive and foundational, it can be summarized by focusing on 3 core principles: Respect for Persons, Beneficence, and Justice. In your future work in the research proposal and article critique, I want you to be very cognizant of these virtues in your writing and reading.\n\n\n\nRespect for Persons\n\nConsists of two applications: Autonomy and respect for limited autonomy\nAll people are autonomous. In practice, this means that we allow each person to guide their own participation or non-participation in a study. They are entitled to sufficient knowledge to weigh benefits and risks. A person cannot be coerced, deceived, or offered excessive incentive to obtain consent.\nSome people are limited in autonomy due to outside factors. There are special groups which are, in one way or another, limited in their ability to give informed consent.\n\nExamples: those with intellectual/developmental disability, minors, prisoners, those under a medical guardianship or power-of-attorney.\nIn these cases, researchers must act with additional precautions to protect vulnerable individuals.\nProcedures may involve obtain consent of a guardian and assent of the person under the guardianship.\n\n\n\n\nBeneficence\n\nThis principle is critically concerned with minimization of harm and acting in the best interests of participants and the broader population represented by the sample of the study.\nNow, studies may, by virtue of the research questions, require some degree of harm. However, it is absolutely necessary that researchers do their best to anticipate, avoid, and negate harm wherever it may occur.\n\nThis often requires that researchers regularly assess the state of participants and ensure they are not unduly harmed by study procedures. Studies may need to be changed (with approval) or outright stopped if risk of harm grows greater than expected.\n\nWithin this principle, is the necessity of ensuring privacy through completely anonymous studies and/or confidential studies. Harm can come to individuals in information is leaked or shared. Institutions will have strict data policies to protect the information gathered about participants in studies.\n\n\n\nJustice\n\nThis principle highlights the importance of considering the larger impact of the study and the potential negative effect on the study participants to achieve such a result.\nWe should avoid using a sample that is convenient or useful by virtue of their position (e.g., those considered “vulnerable” as stated before) to benefit the broader population.\nPut another way, we should be concerned with ensuring that there is equity between the groups under study, and the larger group that benefits from said work."

    "section": "The APA Ethical Principles",
    "text": "The APA Ethical Principles\n\nOverview\n\nThe APA guidelines supplement and apply the Belmont report principles specifically to psychological science and practice. In some ways, it expands and adds further detail to “update” the principals.\n5 core principals (summarized in Table 4.1, pg. 99)\n\nBeneficence and nonmaleficence\nFidelity and responsibility\nIntegrity\nJustice\nRespect for people’s rights and dignity\n\nThese guidelines provide further definition and explanations on a variety of topics, named the Ethical Standards for Research:\n\n\n\nInstitutional Review Boards (IRBs)\n\nThe IRB is the central governing body overseeing ethics in research at any given institution. They are responsible for carefully inspecting and evaluating the planned methods of any given study, but especially human subjects studies.\n\nThe IRB often requests extensive documentation on planned studies and procedures well in advance of when they happen. It is not uncommon to have a nearly completed methods section and introduction sections before a study is even approved\nE.g., Neuropsychological Study at Trinity\n\nThey are a key step in approving research, prior to conducting a study. Without IRB approval, a study cannot proceed.\n\n\n\nInformed Consent\n\nUnder many studies, a researcher must provide each participant a form that indicates the general goals of the study, likely benefits and risks, as well all procedures for a person to revoke participation.\nRegulation do allow for informed consent to be waived under circumstances, such as when data was already gathered (e.g., census data, electronic health record data from routine care) or when a person could “reasonably expect” to be seen by the general public. However, this waiver must be explicitly asked for and explained.\nIRBs carefully weigh whether a study must employ informed consent forms based on the risk to individuals and data anonymity.\n\nAs with any component of a study, and IRB can request changes or outright force a certain course of actions\n\n\n\n\nDeception\n\nIntentional deception and vagueness as part of a study’s methodology are fairly common and can be done ethically, with caveats.\n\nExamples: Milgram’s shocks, confederates (actors), etc.\nLie by leaving information out is called omission where intentionally giving false information is called commission. Deception should only be used to the point that it is absolutely necessary to the goals of the study.\n\nFirst, the deception must be rationalized as necessary to the goals and validity of the study. It must be done intentionally to protect specific goals and threats to the study.\n\nFor example, a participant who knows a study is about implicit bias towards and out-group may act unlike their normal self in order to appear “better”\n\nSecond, this deception must be thoroughly planned and explained to the IRB, with appropriate debrief planned for after completion of the study.\nDeception isn’t a universally loved practice, but many recognize it as a necessary part of studies to isolate psychological effects from bias in participants.\n\n\n\nDebriefing\n\nDebriefing sessions occur with participant after their participation in the study, in which the methods used are explained, and any deception is revealed.\nResearchers may share results with people, so they are aware of findings, and can possibly benefit from the research. Functionally, we debrief for the same reason we share full procedures in published work: to increase trust in the process and science.\n\n\n\nResearch Misconduct\n\nThis term is mostly related to the deadly practices of Data fabrication and/or falsification.\nFabrication: When data is created to support certain conclusions\nFalsification: When data is selectively pruned, filtered, or treated to bias it towards favorable conclusions. This is also relevant when procedures are use that bias participants in their reactions.\nBoth of these acts of research misconduct may have wide and longstanding effects on professional careers of researchers, as well as public effects\n\nThe original study on ASD and vaccines is retracted! But its effects are still pervasive to this day…\n\n\n\n\nOpenness and Transparency\n\nAs a general rule, one should readily share the procedures, analyses, and data used to complete research (see Merton’s openness norm) - unless to share these would jeopardize the security and privacy of subjects.\n\nNot all data sharing is allowed by certain organizations - sometimes this decision is somewhat out of the researcher’s hands\n\nPre-registered hypotheses, data sharing agreements, and code-sharing can all be helpful practices to allow research practices to be better inspected by interested parties. It can also be useful in catching small errors, leading to corrections or retractions when necessary.\n\n\n\nPlagiarism\n\nPlagiarism is said to be passing another person’s work or words off as your own. It is especially easy to do in research writing, when we rapidly state claims and evidence from prior literature.\nPlagiarism can be both un-intentional/accidental or fully intentional - however, the implications of both types are largely the same, and the consequences tend to be equally severe.\nIt is also possible to self-plagiarize. This may seem paradoxical, but the reuse of the same sentences as part of a new work implies that the sentence originated in the new work, when it did not. When submitting graded or publishable work, it is expected that the piece is novel and unique to other work.\nThe two strategies for avoiding plagiarism are to use good paraphrasing and proper APA 7th citations and references. We covered this earlier in our workshop introducing APA style.\n\n\n\nAnimal Research\nThis will be less of a focus for this class, but you will need to have some general notions of the nuance in this area. Generally, animals should be used sparingly, and should be treated with the utmost respect for their contributions to studies.\n\nLab animals (those kept explicitly for research purposes) have specific ethic guidelines governing their care, habitat, and treatment.\nLab animals are governed by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), a sort of IRB-for-animals\n3 Rs\n\nReplacements: try to find alternatives to using animals, wherever possible\nRefinement: minimize harm to animals with better, less intrusive lab procedures\nReduction: Try to use as few animals as possible\n\nPublic opinion on animals can be very mixed, and certain advocacy groups seek to outright ban the use of animals in lab studies. However, many also recognize that use of animals is tightly governed (just like with humans) and critical to some areas of research especially dangerous for humans (like early stage clinical trials)."

Most organizations require the completion of ethics certifications programs through the CITI program, prior to being part of formal research teams.\nEthical decision-making will combine with what we’ve learned about crafting and evaluating claims so that we can reasonably balance the many components of a good research project. Your research proposal and article critique will both need to address ethical concerns around research, in addition to the already established validities and claim types."

However, the focus of our conclusions is not the measured variable, but rather, the construct that it purports to measure.\n\nExample: when I assign a test, do I care only about the plain number of items correct a student has? NO! I care about the content mastery that the items are representative of.\n\nGenerally, when we talk about theories, we are discussing constructs; and when we are talking about study-specific hypotheses, we discuss operational variables.\nSide note: The gap between operational to latent variables is an extremely important area that deals with measure validity, which is different from the validity we will be discussing shortly. This area of study deals with Measurement and Test Theories, as well as psychometrics (my favorite)."

    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\n\nAlongside the theory-hypothesis-data framework we discussed early in the semester, and the reading strategy I offered for empirical articles - these 4 validities will make up the backbone on how you approach critiquing scientific claims.\nAn overview table of the 4 validity types can be found on pg. 69, Table 3.5\n\n\nConstruct Validity\n\nConstruct validity is all about how well the variables under study are operationalized, manipulated, and measured. This is often closely related to the operational measures one chooses to capture the latent/construct variables.\nFaults in construct validity imply a failure to properly represent the constructs under study, and will lead to a disconnect between the study and the theory under study\nWe will discuss more about “good” measurement practices in chapter 5 and its accompanying lecture\n\n\n\nExternal Validity\n\nExternal validity, also sometimes called generalizability, is all about how well the claims and results of a study/hypothesis apply to the broader population and other contexts. This tends to be primarily determined by how tightly controlled a study is (more control = less generalizable to daily life) and how individuals were sampled for a study (more on this in chapter 7).\nFaults in external validity lead to limitations in how well a claim can be extrapolated and abstracted outside the context of a study.\nExample: is a tightly-controlled clinical study on mice in a lab cage readily applicable to the average person in their daily life? No!\n\n\n\nStatistical Validity\nThis will be covered further in-depth in PSY-350\n\nStatistical Validity is all about whether the estimates, p-values, effect sizes, and analysis methods support the hypothesis in question.\nHelpful questions to ask:\n\nDid the authors state an \\(\\alpha\\) level in the methods?\nDid the paper report adequate statistical information to assess significance? (e.g., p-values, confidence intervals, effect sizes - ideally all\n\n\n\n\n\nDid the authors themselves actually interpret this information correctly?\nWas the analysis powerful enough to detect an effect? (e.g., big enough sample)\n\nFailures in this type of validity compromise the conclusions made in the discussion, which comes from the results.\n\n\n\nInternal Validity\n\nInternal validity is most closely related to how well confounds are controlled for and noted in a study. Researchers may use a combination of design controls (which we will discuss in this class) and statistical controls (which are more relevant to PSY-350).\nFailure to properly address these will result in uncertainty on the actual causation/association mechanism between two or more variables.\nThis tends be be one of the trickiest validities to fully meet, and one that many people fail to account for in intuition and personal experience. This is where the famous phrase comes from: “Correlation does not equal causation” - because people fail to account for all the necessary 3 components for causal claims."

The one exception is that internal validity is not really applicable to frequency claims.\n\nRegardless, walk through the book examples as they are good examples on thinking your way through more applied problems."

Prepare for class periods to last the entirety of the scheduled course time. In-person classes will not be recorded, but some materials will be available to students who may have missed a class period due to excused absences (see [Attendence] and Due Dates).\nOutside of class, students should work diligently and efficiently on assigned coursework. Textbook readings, as indicated on the Schedule, are always required and not optional. The readings will be tested upon and are essential for being prepared for content during the class period. I also require you submit your textbook notes for a subset of the chapters (i.e., “Reading Evidence”) In this course, my lectures and the assigned readings will be closely linked and should be viewed as complimentary to each other. I will ensure lectures cover the key content from each chapter. We only meet once every week, so students are expected to manage their own time well, and to finish all assignments in advance of the deadlines provided in the Schedule."

    "text": "Integrity, Plagiarism, & Academic Dishonesty\nThis course will challenge students to grow skills in responsible and ethical research, in which one of the most essential abilities is writing in a way that gives proper attribution and credit. When drafting a paper, presentation, report, or any type of assignment we must take care to use our own words and thoughts, and cite the scholars that we build from. In the academic world, plagiarism, fabrication, and confabulation are some of the most egregious crimes, and have resulted in de-funding of labs, loss of grants, and the destruction of professional reputations.\nI will hold students to the same high standards of the professional research world, as I wish to ensure all of you are able to leave this course confident in your ability to conduct and write ethical research. I will help all students steadily build these skills, and do expect early mistakes that need correction. However, any evidence of intentional or negligent plagiarism or academic dishonesty will be handled in line with the GVSU Student Code.\nAs described by the GVSU Student Code, “Offering the work of someone else as one’s own is plagiarism…” “Any ideas or material taken from another source for either written or oral presentation must be fully acknowledged.” “Depending on the instructor’s judgment of the particular case, he/she may … give a failing grade for the … entire course.” Simply rearranging the words or substituting synonyms in the original source is still plagiarism. Details about the APA method for citing research will be provided during the course. Furthermore, students should not self-plagiarize, that is, reuse their own work from another course.\nStudents are permitted to be in study groups and learn from one another, but all submitted work should be distinct and unique to each individual. I would recommend you only study in groups for quizzes or exams, but complete other work (e.g., Article Critique, Research Proposal, etc.) as an individual, to avoid unintentional plagiarism. Students in other sections of this course, with other professors, may not have perfectly aligned content with the pace of this section."

    "text": "Use of AI Tools\nThe following statement should be understood as constituting my policy on use of AI tools in this course:\nAI Policy Statement by David A. Joyner (davidjoyner@fediscience.org)\n\n“We treat AI-based assistance, such as ChatGPT and Copilot, the same way we treat collaboration with other people: you are welcome to talk about your ideas and work with other people, both inside and outside the class, as well as with AI-based assistants.\nHowever, all work you submit must be your own. You should never include in your assignment anything that was not written directly by you without proper citation (including quotation marks and in-line citation for direct quotes).\nIncluding anything you did not write in your assignment without proper citation will be treated as an academic misconduct case. If you are unsure where the line is between collaborating with AI and copying from AI, we recommend the following:\n\nNever hit “Copy” within your conversation with an AI assistant. You can copy your own work into your conversation, but do not copy anything from the conversation back into your assignment. Instead, use your interaction with the AI assistant as a learning experience, then let your assignment reflect your improved understanding.\nDo not have your assignment and the AI agent open at the same time. Similar to above, use your conversation with the AI as a learning experience, then close the interaction down, open your assignment, and let your assignment reflect your revised knowledge. This includes avoiding using AI directly integrated into your composition environment: just as you should not let a classmate write content directly into your submission, so also avoid using tools that directly add content to your submission.”\n\n\nWhile “AI”, as we know it, may be a useful tool for learning and troubleshooting, it is never an acceptable replacement for graded and professional work. For the work in this course, I’d strongly recommend you rely upon class content, the textbook, and peer-reviewed scientific research to study and build your skills. If I have reason to believe that AI tools have been used to generate work passed off as your own, I will investigate it the same as any other form of academic dishonesty (see Integrity, Plagiarism, & Academic Dishonesty). I implore you to maintain a high level of integrity in your work and I will take appropriate measures to detect and investigate unethical use of AI tools."

Please ensure all electronic devices are silenced during class (medical devices that must alert for the well-being of the user are exempt).

You should plan to make every attempt to attend our regularly scheduled course times so that you may complete any necessary assessments. Take-home assignments are due at the start of class time.\nIf you expect that a qualifying pre-existing obligation, that cannot be moved, will interfere with class time, please reach out to me at least one week prior to the affected course meeting. So that we may make arrangements for you to turn in relevant work, and take any missed Quizzes or Exams. If you find yourself in an emergency situation that prevents your attendance in class/turning in work on time, please notify me as soon as possible and provide documentation on what your emergency was (e.g., doctor’s note).\nI will work with students to ensure you have the opportunity to submit your work and make it up. Barring extraordinary circumstances, you must reach out to me within 48 hours of the original due date to coordinate an appropriate time to submit the work.\nIn the cases of missed work needing to be made up, I ask that we complete the work prior to the next class period as to not delay review of exams or quizzes for your peers. It is the student’s responsibility to contact me regarding make-up work - failure to do so in a timely manner (48 hrs) will result in the total forfeiture of points.\nBarring exemptions, as explained above, late work will have 25% of earned points deducted per each day late (including weekends). Work is considered to be a day late immediately after submission for assignments at the start of the class period. Example: a paper (50 points total) is submitted 2 days late, and earns 40/50 points - this paper will have 50% of earned points deducted, resulting in a 20/50. Thus, after 4 days late, an assignment will not be eligible for any points.\nPlease submit all assignments through their respective Blackboard Ultra submissions, regardless of whether they are late or not. Do not email me or hand in paper copies of assignments unless I request so - I will redirect you to submit through Blackboard."

This will be especially helpful during open-notes quizzes and when you are filling out exam study guides. If you choose to use bolding, underlines, italics, and/or colors, please do so in an informative and intuitive way."

While you do not have to follow that style exactly, do think about using some structure to keep related concepts grouped together. Along with the styling options I highlighted above, you have a nice variety of ways to keep your notes in a readable, accessible manner."

    "text": "Think Abstract\nIt is very easy to just take notes on what is written exactly in the book and nothing more (in a very concrete manner). It is advantageous to try to connect concepts to examples and add your own thoughts in. I personally like giving “commentary” on what I read as I write, so I basically have to take the content in and react to it somehow. Doing things like this can aid in memorization and also help connect topics across units. You learn best when you find a way to make the content applicable to you."

    "text": "Read BEFORE Lectures\nWhile this is a hard habit to make, it is one likely to pay dividends. I would strongly suggest that you read the textbook chapter for a week before you come to the lecture with the corresponding content. It will help familiarize you with the concepts and prompt you to consider what questions you may have. That way, in class, you can readily ask me about things that are confusing. I like to take notes from the book, and then “mark them up” with content from the lecture to help connect the spoken content with the written material."

They will be paper forms (i.e., not on Blackboard).\nExams are timed, 113 minutes total (previously was 75 minutes).\nExams are not open-note, open-book, or collaborative. You are not permitted to use any form of assistance to aid you during the tests. Do not discuss the test with other students, even after it has concluded.\nAny indication of academic dishonesty or “cheating” will be investigated thoroughly and will result in an automatic 0 on the exam for offenders\nExams will be ended early if all students are clearly finished and content with their answers.\nExams will be graded promptly and reviewed the following week.\nExams will contain content from the entire unit, from lectures, readings, and other class activities. This will include content from weeks/chapter 1 though 6.\nExams will not be purely vocabulary-based, students should have a solid understanding of applications of concepts, ideas, and theories.\n\n\n\nUsing This Study Guide & Other Resources\nThis study guide is meant to help get students started with guided questions and tasks that will aid performance on Exam 1. It is laid out as examples and open-ended questions to provoke thought on the most pressing questions of each chapter. You may consider using the slides, recorded lectures, and textbook to help you address each part. However, there are other valuable resources you may use to help you prepare:\n\nReview the textbook and professor learning objectives throughout the slides and chapters.\nUse the questions (“Check Your Understanding”) throughout the chapters to quiz yourself and use the lengthy review sections at the end of each chapter to get a nice sampling of practice activities.\nUse the results and answers from the weekly quizzes to identify areas of need for studying.\nMake flashcards for important vocabulary.\nRe-watch recorded lectures to see if you missed any classes and to ensure you haven’t missed any critical content.\nIf you exhaust your other options for reviewing content, please feel free to ask me questions as well.\n\nIf you wish to perform your best, you should use a combination of all of these available resources to help you prepare. Furthermore, I make no guarantee that this study guide will contain all the information on the exam - it is the student’s responsibility to review all materials related to the first 6 weeks of content.\n\n\nChapter/Week 1\n\nWhat is a research producer? What is a job title this person is likely to have? What sorts of activities is this person likely to perform?\nWhat is a research consumer? What is a job title this person is likely to have? What sorts of activities is this person likely to perform?\nDescribe the procedures, findings, and structure of Harlow’s monkey study to investigate cupboard theory vs. contact comfort theory.\nDescribe the concept of Empiricism and its relationship to the Theory-Hypothesis-Data Cycle. Define and explain each individual part of the cycle.\nHow are Empiricism, the process of reproducing scientific studies, and the self-correcting nature of science related?\nWhat are Merton’s 4 Scientific Norms? Be able to give definitions of each and examples of behaviors that support these norms.\nWhy don’t we use the word “prove” in science, and why do we prefer using the weight of evidence to describe support for a claim? Write out an example of what an improper claim statement (i.e., one being too certain) may look like, and then give a “fixed” version of that statement.\nWhat are the 3 contexts/types of research? Give an example of a study that would be described as each type.\nCompare and contrast the methods and trust-worthiness of scientific journalism and scientific articles published in peer-reviewed journals. See if you can find an example of both types, or better, find a piece of journalism and then the original article the journalism was based upon.\nWhat citation style do we use in this course? What are the core, important components of a full citation (Like that found in a “References” section)? Looking at the information of an article, try to type out the correct formatted citation for it. What are some shortcuts in Google Scholar or scientific databases to get the citation information?\n\n\n\nChapter/Week 2\n\nWhat are the 4 sources of knowledge or information we can draw from? Which of these is the most sound?\nWhy do we consider research to be superior to authority? Provide 2 examples of faults in trusting authority.\nWhy do we consider research to be superior to personal experience? Provide 2 examples of faults in relying on personal experience.\nWhy do we consider research to be superior to intuition? Provide 2 examples of biases in intuition.\nDescribe the dangers of confounds and having no comparison groups. What issues do these introduce? Describe an example of a confound.\nWhat does is mean that research is probabilistic? How does this affect how we apply research findings to individual people?\nDescribe the 6 biases we discussed in intuition. Write an example of each bias.\nWhat is the difference between an original empirical article, a literature review, and a meta-analysis? Try to find an example of each of these using the techniques we learned to find research.\nWhat type of search engine should I use in order to find peer-reviewed journal articles? Give two examples of appropriate tools. Find a scientific article that is specifically about traumatic brain injury and recovery.\nWhat are the procedures for fully inspecting a research article before using it?\nWhy are books in science generally less valued as a source, compared to scientific journal articles? Connect this back to criticisms of authority.\n\n\n\nChapter/Week 3\n\nDefine a variable and a constant. Give an example of each in a research setting.\nWhat are the 3 different scales of measurement for variables? Give an example of a variable of each type.\nWhat is the difference between a measured and manipulated variables? What are some reasons a measure may have to measured, and could not be manipulated?\nCompare and contrast construct and operational variables. What are examples of both of these? For the construct of anxiety, propose a simple operational measure.\nWhat are the 3 types of claims we can make? Give one example of each type and a few keywords that signal each type of claim. Which of these claims requires the “hardest” burden to investigate?\nWhat statistical and graphical methods do we have for presenting information about associative claims? How does one interpret each of these?\nWhat are the three specified criteria that must be met that allow us to determine causation between two or more things?\nWhat are the 4 claim validities for examining scientific claims? For each validity, give one example of a detriment and one example of a benefit. Which of the validities is only really applicable to causal claims?\nDescribe some primary issues in the conclusions of Mak et al. (2023; the article we walked through in class). With each one of the validities, how well does the article meet them?\n\n\n\nChapter/Week 4\n\nIn the case of Prof. Gino of Harvard Business School, what were the primary accusations levied against her, and what was her response? What were the consequences of her actions?\nBe able to explain the general structure and goals of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study and the Milgram Obedience Studies.\nDescribe the questionable/bad ethics of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study and the Milgram Obedience Studies. In what way did these studies cause undue harm or fail the participants? Connect these failing to specific principles or guidelines in the APA Code of Ethics.\nEnumerate the 3 principles of the Belmont Report and the 5 principles of the APA Code of Ethics. Be able to define each of these in detail.\nDescribe the relationship between informed consent, deception, and debriefing. In what cases would deception be allowed?\nWhat are the governing bodies for ensuring ethical research procedures at any institution? In what ways can they influence and regulate ongoing projects?\nExplain the difference between the two types of research misconduct - which type was Prof. Gino (credibly) accused of?\nThe first chapter mentioned “Pre-registration” of hypotheses - which of the APA Code of Ethics does this best relate to?\nDescribe a situation where ethics and study validity may be at odds or in conflict. What is an example of a study that would be scientifically valid, but not ethical?\n\n\n\nChapter/Week 5\n\nWhat type of variable requires a conceptual definition?\nWhat are the 3 types or mediums of psychological measures? Provide an example of each type and describe what these might look like in practice.\nWhat is the relationship between measurement reliability and validity? What claim validity do these both fall under?\nDescribe the concept of reliability: what is a good synonym for it? Provide a real life example of something “unreliable” in the measurement sense. What are the 3 types of reliability discussed in class?\nWhat is the most common graphical and statistical method to assess reliability? How does one interpret each of these graphs and statistics? (You do not need to know how to calculate statistics, but you should know what certain values would imply)\nDefine measurement validity - what is a good synonym for it? What are the 5 types of measurement validity we discussed in class? Which of these are the “weakest” or the most subjective?\nWhat are the two methods by which to investigate criterion validity? What sorts of analyses do we use in the case of either type?\nUsing the visual analogy of targets (as presented in class), what would a reliable, but invalid tool look like?\nBy what methods can we find established measures for common psychological constructs? How is this similar to searching for scientific literature?\n\n\n\nChapter/Week 6\n\nWhen we use the terms survey or pool what type/medium are we referring to? What are the roughly 4 types of questions we talked about in class? Write an example of each question type.\nWhat are the 4 threats we discussed in how questions are written? What are the available solutions to address each one of these threats?\nDescribe what a response set is and why it is undesirable in participant responses. What are the 3 to 4 response sets we talked about, and how can we attempt to prevent them in our research?\nDescribe the concerns in long-term memory and peoples’ ability to introspect on why they do something, which could affect our survey results?\nDescribe the difference between an observational measure and a self-report one. Why might a psychologist see one as more “objective” than the other?\nWhat are the 3 major concerns to measurement validity in observational measures? Give an example of each one of these occurring and how we might solve each.\nIn what ways may we choose to use deception in observation tools to enhance validity?\n\n\n\nInter-chapter Questions\nThese questions are meant to compound different ideas from the lecture and synthesize what we have learned so far. They are difficult, but also realistically how complex research normally is.\n\nI want to run a study observing people at my local mall and their shopping and impulsive buying tendencies - what sort of consent do I need from the participants? If I want to give them a self-report form, and interact with them directly, does that change how I need to get consent? Is there an existing measure for understanding shopping tendencies I can find somewhere? If I need to make a new measure, what sorts of questions do I put on it?\nI want to publish research that I did as (hypothetically) a high-school student. I didn’t have any supervision but I planned and ran it all just fine, it was a study about giving supplements to people and seeing their reactions over time. Now I can’t get any journal to publish it, only because I am a high school student and don’t have credentials. What scientific principals may be violated here, both by journals and by the student?"

It is widely-accepted as a valid way to structure reports, papers, and presentations\nWe will not cover every single recommendation made by the manual, as some content is more related to general writing or statistical reporting (which will be more relevant in the PSY-350 course)\nOf most concern to this course is understanding how and where to use in-text citations, and how to properly report the full citations in a references section"

    "text": "Bias in Intuition\n\nRecall that intuition is often like a “hunch” or a “gut feeling”. We may describe intuition as being “pre-scientific.”\nUnfortunately, our intuition may be swayed by certain sources of bias in how we think…\n\n\nConvincing Narratives\n\nHave you ever met someone who could really sell a story? Maybe a friend who is really good at making stuff up or a salesperson.\nFreud certainly could! Many of his early theories drew on observations that seemed reasonable enough, and his psychoanalytic theory is prevalent to this day.\n\nThis is a sort of “just-makes-sense” thought process, where we think - “well, naturally, it works that way”\n\nDiscuss: can you think of any good stories that turned out to be false?\nHowever, this intuition can be an incorrect assumption (see Scared Straight program) and may prevent us from fully exploring whether things are actually as we think they are\n\n\n\nAvailability Heuristic\n\nAnyone afraid of shark attacks in the ocean?\nYou may think that they happen often, but really, they are exceedingly rare. But because of popular media and news hype, the idea of shark attacks is much more readily available cognitively\nA heuristic is just a cognitive shortcut, it allows us to skip the process of thinking to come to conclusion. However, in the scientific theory-data-hypothesis cycle, it threatens to obscure what is actually going on\nThis heuristic often causes over- or under- estimations of certain situations occurring\n\n\n\nPresent/Present Bias\n\nThe present/present bias may be best understood as an extension of failing to account for comparison groups (see No Comparison)\n\nIf we don’t see a possible outcome, do we fully account for it? Remember Harlow’s monkeys’ third option…\n\nThis may be understood as also reflecting a tendency to recall certain (critical) events, but not others\n\n\n\n\nConfirmation Bias\n\nThis is our tendency to protect our already closely-held beliefs by selectively praising, criticizing, and noticing information that reinforces the belief\n\nEspecially relevant to situations like politics, where people have a great motivation to protect “their” perspectives\n\nThis often causes extreme bias in evidence-gathering and is likely to lead to a single conclusion: “I’m right”\nExample:\n\nGoogle search: “Evidence that the earth is flat” vs.\n“Evidence of the earth’s shape”\n\n\n\n\nBias Blind Spot\n\nRecall those last few examples of bias? You are just as susceptible to those same fallacies as anyone else.\nIt pays dividends to be humble and curious towards possibilities, even when our intuition, experiences, and even research may say otherwise.\nEspecially as scientists, there is a temptation to believe we are uniquely resistant to bias, we aren’t\n\nWant to eliminate bias? Prove it with sound science, methods, and reporting"

It isn’t just because the researchers are “published”, but rather, that the peer-review process is well set up to prevent poor science from slipping through\n\nTherefore, we must interrogate the method by which a person comes to a conclusion, rather than basing our opinion of the person.

A more quantitative version of a classic literature review.\n\n\n\n(Edited) Books\n\nScientific Books: a full-length scientific book written by the same single or multiple authors throughout. Focuses on a single topic, and functions as a sort of extended literature review.\nEdited Books: a collaborative effort in which many experts compose chapters on specific topics. These are usually not peer-reviewed to the same extent as journal articles - but the authors are usually some of the most respected researchers in an area. Be careful of appeal to authority because of this!\n\nThese are popular among applied practitioners of psychology (consumers), because it allows them to keep up with developments and ideas in a nice range of areas."

    "text": "Question Formats\n\nQuestion types range from least to most restrictive, with different types having varying drawbacks to use.\nOpen-ended questions are those that allow respondents to reply in sentences and paragraphs not necessarily bound to one format. While capturing the “most” information, these questions are difficult to transform into quantitative findings - in fact, some researchers would say they should not be transformed at all\n\nThis is the most common type of question in qualitative research, where the goal is to often capture the full, anecdotal experience of participants.\nNote: In this class, we will be almost entirely focused on quantitative research, which is that which uses statistical analysis and operationalized experiences to numbers.\n\nForced-choice questions are those that restrict respondents to only responding to a question or prompt is a specified number of ways.\n\nFor example, any multiple-choice or true-false assessment is forced choice.\nThink about how forced-choice naturally limits participants in sharing the full breadth of their experience.\n\nLikert scale is ordinal scale question that asks a participant to respond to a statement or questions with 5 possible answers:\n\nStrongly agree\nAgree\nNeither agree nor disagree\nDisagree\nStrongly Disagree\n\nA question that is similar in structure but has more or less options than those 5 should be referred to as a Likert-type scale\nSemantic Differential is a format that asks a respondent to respond to a prompt with a “rating” between two descriptors or adjectives. Ex. This could be a “star” system for rating satisfaction.\nQuestion formats do not inherently prevent or add to construct validity, however they will have an impact on the type of analysis one can use. Likert, Likert-type, and Semantic Differential will all produce ordinal data. Forced choice is likely to be categorical. And open-ended is a whole other thing entirely…\n\nBe mindful of how you will perform analysis before making a survey!"

    "section": "“Good” Questions",
    "text": "“Good” Questions\n\nQuestion writing can have a large impact on the measurement and construct validity of a question - writing good questions is often time-consuming and intense!\nWhile there are many ways for a question to go “wrong”? There are a few pitfalls that are especially common and dangerous…\n\n\nLeading Questions\n\nLeading questions are when a question is worded or designed in such a way that is likely to bias respondents towards a certain answer or outcome. This can be accidental, or intentional.\nIn general, avoid using terms that are “emotional” in nature - like “awful”, “bad”, “dangerous”, etc. If your questions is likely to play up the emotion of your participant, it is possibly a leading question.\n\n\n\nDouble-barreled Questions\n\nThis occurs when a question is actually two questions wrapped into one. The problem is that this might cause confusion in capturing the real opinions or feelings of an individual.\nA good way to spot this mistakes is if you see an “and” anywhere in the question - tread cautiously\n\n\n\nNegative Wording\n\nNegative wording is when a question is worded in such a manner that confounds the directionality of a question.\n\nEx. “Do you not agree with…”\n\nNot only can this be difficult to properly analyze in a study, it can also be generally very confusing to participants and produce inaccurate responses.\nWherever possible, avoid “not”, “nor”, “neither” and other negative words in surveys. Sometimes, these sort of issues can be rectified by splitting a question up, similar to procedures for double-barreled questions.\nIf a question is split up to be both a negative and positive version, one can use a correlation matrix and Cronbach’s \\(\\alpha\\) to ensure that same-direction questions correlate well with one another (and if they don’t - we have a problem)\n\n\n\nQuestion Order\n\nThis is a complicated issue and can be hard to fully prevent problems with. Identifying this issue is sometimes best investigated through a pilot study, which occurs before the primary study, and is usually meant to ensure that a measure is sound before rolling out to the “real sample”.\nTo catch a question order effect, you may use two different versions of the measure, with a different order of questions, and give those versions to two different groups. Then compare the answers of the groups to see if they are similar or not. If they differ, there is something in the order affecting the scores.\n“Solving” this issue often involves a good, robust understanding of the literature and some reasoning as to why participants may react a certain way to delicate questions."

    "section": "Getting Accurate Responses",
    "text": "Getting Accurate Responses\n\nSurveys are, effectively, always a self-report - they require an introspection on the part of the respondent. In a lot of research, we must trust and place value in the ability of a person to report on their internal experiences.\nHowever, for a variety of reasons, we must be cautious of certain response sets, which are when a participant follows a trend of responses which may not be particularly informative. In the worst case, a response set represents careless responding by the participant, which confounds results.\nResponse sets generally occur more often in Likert or Likert-type scales\n\n\nAcquiescence / Yea-saying\n\nThis occurs when a participant carelessly selects the most positive answer (e.g., Strongly Agree) or yes throughout a measure\nWhen a respondent is yea-saying, it makes it incredibly difficult to discern whether that accurately represents their opinions/disposition.\nWe may try to use reverse-coded questions to detect this - Ex:\n\n“I feel happy most of the time”\n“I feel sad most of the time”\n\n\n\n\nFence Sitting\n\nThis is when a person keeps choosing the middle or neutral option\nThis can be resolved by removing the middle option, but this also limits the inclusiveness of the question. We may also choose to use a forced-choice self-report to force choosing between categories.\n\n\n\nSocially Desirable Responding / Faking Good\n\nThis is when one takes a certain response trend where they intentionally try to respond in a way that seems good to most people, maybe due to embarrassment or shame\n\nEx., On a personality scale I answer in an overly-altruistic manner\n\nWe may also be concerned with faking bad/malingering, which is especially true in medical or neuropsychological settings\nWe can help limit these sets by including special exaggeration questions that would be absurd for anyone to be that good or bad. We can also ensure participants know results are anonymous. Finally, we may also get converging evidence from collateral reports as well."

    "text": "Other Confounds in Surveys\n\nWe may often run into other unexpected problems with our self reports and surveys in general related to people’s ability to introspect accurately\nOne issue is that people sometimes may choose options intuitively, and may not know why they made a choice. There may be a number of underlying cognitive reasons for answering a certain way, even if people don’t know it!\nAccuracy of memory, especially, can be a tricky subject and when we ask for people to report on more distant memories, we may get responses that may not be quite accurate. Just because someone reports confidence in their memory, also does not necessarily mean that it is accurate. The best way we can navigate this issue is try to get additional information or sources."

    "section": "Reliability and Validity in Observation Data",
    "text": "Reliability and Validity in Observation Data\n\nConstruct validity in observational data can be confounded by 3 types of biases: observer bias, observer effects, and reactivity.\n\n\nObserver Bias\n\nDepending on the circumstances, observers may be bias to “see” a certain result in participants due to some preconceived notions or beliefs\nThis is why it is important to have observers blind to the study they may be observing and to have rigorous training that helps ensure a smooth and consistent process (double-checked with reliability analysis! - but what type…)\n\nIt is common to use codebooks to clearly highlight how a variable or behavior is to be defined for a particular study.\n\nBlinded studies may also be called “masked studies”.\n\n\n\nObserver Effects\n\nObserver effects are when participants act un-natural in response to the behaviors or perspectives of the researchers. Participants may readily act a certain way to appear “good” or they may be intentionally careful or stiff or modify actions as they watch how experiments react.\nParticipants may also be unintentionally reacting to the behaviors of the observers as well!\nThe same solutions can help, especially blinding the observers, because they won’t be unconsciously swayed by their knowledge.\n\n\n\nReactivity\n\nReactivity is somewhat similar to Observer effects, but hinges on the mere presence of the observer causing behavior changes in the participant.\nThe book proposes three solutions to minimize reactive behaviors\nFind some way to be “unobtrusive” in observation, whether viewing from afar or outside the view of the subject\nAllow a subject to acclimate to having you there and let any initial reactivity die out\nMeasure residual results of the behavior once the subject themself is gone - but this is still observational\n\n\n\nEthics in Observation\n\nLike any procedures planned for research, observation techniques and tools need to be approached in an ethical and sensible manner, with informed consent/debrief telling participants how and why their data is used\nSome deception, such as watching through a one-way mirror may be permissible (if allowed by the IRB), as long as it has good, scientific rationale."

In the case of this article, I specifically commented that the graphs gave an excellent visual aid to understand the tightly clustered nature of the different conditions.\nWhenever you are looking for something related to internal validity, we are often going to be focused on words like “confounds”, “mediators”, “moderator”, “cause” - because that validity is focused on the like between the manipulated (experimental) and the measured (outcome) variables\nA randomized controlled trial (RCT) is a clinical research design term that is, effectively, a type of experiment - which IS a valid design for investigating causal claims. The “randomized” refers to random assignment (a critical part of experiments) and the “controlled” alludes to the tight control for confounds that experiments should have.\n\nRe: this statement: “Among patients who have suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI), most patients see a logarithmic return of cognitive skills post-injury”\n\nThis is a frequency claim, which is indicated by the word “most”. I am saying that a greater proportion of people have this trend of recovery.\n\nRe: this statement: “Time (in seconds) to complete a 100 m dash”\n\nWill be a continuous/interval/ratio type data, as it has a clear, consistent, known distance between points - we know how long is in between two seconds. That alone makes it continuous in nature. It is not ordinal, because that would imply we don’t know the distance between two values in the scale."

For example:\n\nA chemist is able to measure parts of solutions with pH, graduated cylinders, etc.\nPhysicists can measure weight, mass, speed, velocity with time and scales\nBiologists can measure numbers of animals or number of times a certain trait appears in a creature\nIn psychology, we cannot directly measure cognitive traits that are internal to people, and even in behaviors things may be complicated…\n\nRemember that construct validity: we must make operational variables from latent/conceptual/construct variables, and we must do this well!"

Understand the assumptions that your tool makes before you use it.\n\nLecture example: take the concept of “intelligence” - what even is intelligence?\n\nDepends on whom we ask: Weschler says different from Binet says different from …\nWe also may ask: is cognitive intelligence different from emotional intelligence different from social intelligence\nDo we take into account age?

    "text": "Correlation Coefficient\n\nTo mathematically calculate the direction and strength of relationship between two variables we may use \\(r\\). The type we will be talking about now is technically called Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient \\(r\\).\n\\(r\\) will always be between -1 and 1, with 0 representing no correlation or relationship and -1/1 representing a perfectly strong relationship between the two. In practice, you will never get exactly 0 or -1/1, but likely some number in between.\n\n\\[\nr=\\frac{\\sum{(x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}}{\\sqrt{\\sum{(x_i -\n\\bar{x})^2}\\sum{(y_i - \\bar{y})^2}}}\n\\]\n\nThis correlation coefficient is technically only applicable to continuous data, but is generalizable to ordinal data by using Spearman’s \\(\\rho\\) (rho) or Kendall’s \\(\\tau-B\\) (tau-B).\n\n\nPerfect Positive Relationship\n\ncor(test_1_perf, test_2_perf)\n\n[1] 1\n\n\n\n\nImperfect Positive Relationship\n\ncor(test_1_imperf, test_2_imperf)\n\n[1] 0.9944883\n\n\n\nThe interpretation process is fairly straightforward for inter-rater or test-retest reliability -&gt; higher \\(r\\) = greater consistency/reliability.\nAnother popular statistic for inter-rater reliability is called Cohen’s \\(\\kappa\\) (kappa), but that is only applicable when raters are grouping objects or people. It’s interpretation is the same as \\(r\\).\n\n\n\nInternal Reliability\n\nThe simplest way to arrange this is to use a correlation matrix of all the items of a measure, and calculate the \\(r\\) between each two items. See table 5.3 on in your book (pg 311) as an example.\nIn such a table, we are looking to make sure construct-related items are positive, highly correlated and that theoretical unrelated items are negative or weakly correlated.\nYou may also calculate an average inter-item correlation which is just an average correlation across the entire matrix (only recommended if all items should be related)\n\nSide note: I wouldn’t recommend using the acronym AIC for this - most statisticians use that more often for the Akaike information criterion, used often in regression\nWe want roughly between 0.15 and 0.50 for this to be “reliable”\n\nFinally, you can take Cronbach’s \\(\\alpha\\) (alpha) which is taken from the average inter-item correlation and number of items on a scale.\n\nThis is probably the “preferred” statistic for internal reliability\nAbove 0.80 is good for self-reports, we want as close to 1 as possible"

They both are individual steps in establishing construct validity.\nA “good” measure (i.e., one with good construct validity) will have evidence of all the following measurement validities, usually across different studies"

    "section": "Face & Content Validity",
    "text": "Face & Content Validity\n\nBoth of these are more subjective validities which relate to whether it seems like a certain measurement captures the concept well. However, they are a little superficial and tend to be more valued when a measurement scale is first proposed, vs. less so when a scale is more established.\nFace validity is largely just an assessment of “well, does it seem like this would work” - may be evaluated by the general public or by experts in a domain\nContent validity asks whether it appears a measurement would capture all components of a theoretical construct. This is usually best assessed by domain experts which have a strong knowledge of the theory underlying a certain construct.\nFor a more empirical, albeit subjective approach, some studies will gather a panel of experts, calculating \\(r\\) or \\(\\kappa\\) for a measurement or the individual items of a measure across the experts. This could be taken as evidence of somewhat decent expert consensus on a tool, but it strays close to an appeal to authority (i.e., the expertise of the judges). For more than 2 judges we would use extensions of those statistics that are applicable to multivariate data (e.g., multivariate regression, G-study, D-study, etc.)"

    "section": "Criterion Validity",
    "text": "Criterion Validity\n\nCriterion validity focuses on whether a measurement is positively associated with behaviors that are also said to be representative of the construct. Now those selected behaviors are also a subjective choice - but this measurement validity can help establish that a measure is related to what behaviors we normally associate with a trait.\n\n\nCorrelative Methods (for Continuous Behavior)\n\nOnce again, we are able to use correlative methods and scatterplots, like those previous discussed.\n\nIn the scatterplot, we would place the number or magnitude of behavior on one axis and the measure on the other axis.\nA strong, positive relationship between the two would be indicative of good criterion validity\n\nFor example, consider we are developing a collateral-report measure for temper in children where a parent reports how often a child engages in disruptive behavior. Now, we sit in a classroom with the child and measure the number of times they engage in disruptive behavior. A higher score on the measure should be associated with a higher number of occurrences of disruptive behavior.\n\n\n\nKnown Groups Methods (for Categorical Behavior Groups)\n\nWe can also assess whether a measure is able to discern differences between some known-groups by some established standard.\n\nThis means that, prior to testing the new measure, we must have some “source of truth” for whether a person belongs to a certain group.\n\nExample: We have two groups of people, those diagnosed with schizophrenia and those not diagnosed with schizophrenia. We have a continuous measure designed to detect psychotic disorders. Are those individuals with schizophrenia and those without scoring different on this measure?\nIn this method, we could use between-groups statistics, such as t-tests and ANOVA to decide whether scores on the measure are significantly different between the known-group members.\n\nIn modern research, you are more likely to see techniques like logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), and area-under-the-curve (AUC) analysis - as these methods are able to detect appropriate “cut-off” scores for the measure that discriminate between the two groups with ideal sensitivity (detection of true positives) and specificity (detection of true negatives)"

Ideally, we want a new measure to strongly correlate with measures for the same construct (convergence) and have little to no relationship with measures for other constructs (divergence).\nJust like the other measurement validities, correlation is our analysis of choice for these\n\n\nConvergence with Related Measures\n\nFor a valid measure, we want high convergence (i.e., strong positive correlation) with tools that are meant to measure the same construct.\n\n\n\nDivergence with Unrelated Measures\n\nFor a valid measure, we want high divergence (i.e., no correlation) with tools that are meant to measure a different construct."

    "text": "7.3 How to Prioritize Certain Validities\n\nAs we have discussed before, no study can be so well-made that it satisfies all validities and answers all questions about a phenomenon. Instead, it is our goal to balance practicality and our available resources to create a reasonably sound study that provides evidence for a part of a broader question.\n\nThis is important to remember both as we create research (research producer) and as we read and assess existing research (research consumer)!\n\nI propose 4 areas to consider when choosing how to prioritize:\n\nType of claim to be made (frequency, association, causal) - see previous sections for discussions on those.\nPracticality: time, resources, funding\nEthics: sampling method, interventions\nImpact: how important and imperative are our findings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nChapter 3 Lecture - Claims and Validity || PSY-300: Research Methods in Psychology"

Instead, its historical significance is that of being the catalyst for a massive research ethics overhaul in the United States, due to its numerous negligent procedures.\nThe study proceeded in intentional secrecy, deceiving both its participants, and the broader American public. The researchers ignored well-founded concerns from whistleblowers and failed to respect the autonomy and well-being of its participants.\n\n\n\n\nThough this was a medical study, the downstream effects and lessons learned from this study are immediately relevant to psychology and all social science research.\n\n\n\n\n\nLessons learned:\n\nParticipants were not treated with respect, autonomy, and dignity. They were deceived, intentionally un-informed of risks and treatments, prevented from finding information that would aid them in making decision about study participation\nParticipants were intimately and immensely harmed. They were allowed to suffer with the effects of the disease, despite the development of valid treatments that would have cured the disease. The study prioritized the possible results over the safety of its participants.\nParticipants were purposefully sampled as members of a vulnerable and oppressed socioeconomic group. The Black men in this study were likely to be poor and have little formal education. Rather than take measures to respect and inform each participant, this was exploited to keep participants unaware."

These experiments were, in part, born out of questions surrounding obedience of citizens and soldiers in the Nazi regime, in Germany.\n\n\n\n\nParticipants often would have some role in inflicting a perceived pain or punishment on to an actor. No actual harm was actually inflicted to the actor (a confederate), but participants did believe that they were inflicting the pain, usually a shock of some degree. If they pushed back against the demand to administer the punishment (even at extreme levels), an authoritative figure would instruct them to continue over and over.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, the flaw does not lie in harm done to the actor - the shocks weren’t real, and were merely simulated. However, think about the emotional distress in the participants - feeling “forced” by authority to perform inhumane actions.\nThough participants were debriefed at the end of the study and met the actor who assured they were fine - there are questions as to whether they were truly told that those shocks were faked. Some participants worried for weeks.\n\n\n\nLessons learned:\n\nMilgram continued the studies, even after learning a staggering 65% of participants would continue the shocks to the end - usually accompanied by extreme emotional distress of the participants.\nWhile the Tuskegee study showed us physical harm to the participants, this study showed us emotional pain inflicted on the participants.

    "section": "7.2 The Belmont Report",
    "text": "7.2 The Belmont Report\nOverview\n\nIn many ways, the Belmont Report is the original and most influential guiding pieces of ethical conduct for any type of human subjects research in the United States.\nThough it is very comprehensive and foundational, it can be summarized by focusing on 3 core principles: Respect for Persons, Beneficence, and Justice. In your future work in the research proposal and article critique, I want you to be very cognizant of these virtues in your writing and reading.\n\nRespect for Persons\n\nConsists of two applications: Autonomy and respect for limited autonomy\nAll people are autonomous. In practice, this means that we allow each person to guide their own participation or non-participation in a study. They are entitled to sufficient knowledge to weigh benefits and risks. A person cannot be coerced, deceived, or offered excessive incentive to obtain consent.\nSome people are limited in autonomy due to outside factors. There are special groups which are, in one way or another, limited in their ability to give informed consent.\n\nExamples: those with intellectual/developmental disability, minors, prisoners, those under a medical guardianship or power-of-attorney.\nIn these cases, researchers must act with additional precautions to protect vulnerable individuals.\nProcedures may involve obtain consent of a guardian and assent of the person under the guardianship.\n\n\nBeneficence\n\nThis principle is critically concerned with minimization of harm and acting in the best interests of participants and the broader population represented by the sample of the study.\nNow, studies may, by virtue of the research questions, require some degree of harm. However, it is absolutely necessary that researchers do their best to anticipate, avoid, and negate harm wherever it may occur.\n\nThis often requires that researchers regularly assess the state of participants and ensure they are not unduly harmed by study procedures. Studies may need to be changed (with approval) or outright stopped if risk of harm grows greater than expected.\n\nWithin this principle, is the necessity of ensuring privacy through completely anonymous studies and/or confidential studies. Harm can come to individuals in information is leaked or shared. Institutions will have strict data policies to protect the information gathered about participants in studies.\n\nJustice\n\nThis principle highlights the importance of considering the larger impact of the study and the potential negative effect on the study participants to achieve such a result.\nWe should avoid using a sample that is convenient or useful by virtue of their position (e.g., those considered “vulnerable” as stated before) to benefit the broader population.\nPut another way, we should be concerned with ensuring that there is equity between the groups under study, and the larger group that benefits from said work."

    "section": "7.3 The APA Ethical Principles",
    "text": "7.3 The APA Ethical Principles\nOverview\n\nThe APA guidelines supplement and apply the Belmont report principles specifically to psychological science and practice. In some ways, it expands and adds further detail to “update” the principals.\n5 core principals (summarized in Table 4.1, pg. 99)\n\nBeneficence and nonmaleficence\nFidelity and responsibility\nIntegrity\nJustice\nRespect for people’s rights and dignity\n\nThese guidelines provide further definition and explanations on a variety of topics, named the Ethical Standards for Research:\n\nInstitutional Review Boards (IRBs)\n\nThe IRB is the central governing body overseeing ethics in research at any given institution. They are responsible for carefully inspecting and evaluating the planned methods of any given study, but especially human subjects studies.\n\nThe IRB often requests extensive documentation on planned studies and procedures well in advance of when they happen. It is not uncommon to have a nearly completed methods section and introduction sections before a study is even approved\nE.g., Neuropsychological Study at Trinity\n\nThey are a key step in approving research, prior to conducting a study. Without IRB approval, a study cannot proceed.\n\nInformed Consent\n\nUnder many studies, a researcher must provide each participant a form that indicates the general goals of the study, likely benefits and risks, as well all procedures for a person to revoke participation.\nRegulation do allow for informed consent to be waived under circumstances, such as when data was already gathered (e.g., census data, electronic health record data from routine care) or when a person could “reasonably expect” to be seen by the general public. However, this waiver must be explicitly asked for and explained.\nIRBs carefully weigh whether a study must employ informed consent forms based on the risk to individuals and data anonymity.\n\nAs with any component of a study, and IRB can request changes or outright force a certain course of actions\n\n\nDeception\n\nIntentional deception and vagueness as part of a study’s methodology are fairly common and can be done ethically, with caveats.\n\nExamples: Milgram’s shocks, confederates (actors), etc.\nLie by leaving information out is called omission where intentionally giving false information is called commission. Deception should only be used to the point that it is absolutely necessary to the goals of the study.\n\nFirst, the deception must be rationalized as necessary to the goals and validity of the study. It must be done intentionally to protect specific goals and threats to the study.\n\nFor example, a participant who knows a study is about implicit bias towards and out-group may act unlike their normal self in order to appear “better”\n\nSecond, this deception must be thoroughly planned and explained to the IRB, with appropriate debrief planned for after completion of the study.\nDeception isn’t a universally loved practice, but many recognize it as a necessary part of studies to isolate psychological effects from bias in participants.\n\nDebriefing\n\nDebriefing sessions occur with participant after their participation in the study, in which the methods used are explained, and any deception is revealed.\nResearchers may share results with people, so they are aware of findings, and can possibly benefit from the research. Functionally, we debrief for the same reason we share full procedures in published work: to increase trust in the process and science.\n\nResearch Misconduct\n\nThis term is mostly related to the deadly practices of Data fabrication and/or falsification.\nFabrication: When data is created to support certain conclusions\nFalsification: When data is selectively pruned, filtered, or treated to bias it towards favorable conclusions. This is also relevant when procedures are use that bias participants in their reactions.\nBoth of these acts of research misconduct may have wide and longstanding effects on professional careers of researchers, as well as public effects\n\nThe original study on ASD and vaccines is retracted! But its effects are still pervasive to this day…\n\n\nOpenness and Transparency\n\nAs a general rule, one should readily share the procedures, analyses, and data used to complete research (see Merton’s openness norm) - unless to share these would jeopardize the security and privacy of subjects.\n\nNot all data sharing is allowed by certain organizations - sometimes this decision is somewhat out of the researcher’s hands\n\nPre-registered hypotheses, data sharing agreements, and code-sharing can all be helpful practices to allow research practices to be better inspected by interested parties. It can also be useful in catching small errors, leading to corrections or retractions when necessary.\n\nPlagiarism\n\nPlagiarism is said to be passing another person’s work or words off as your own. It is especially easy to do in research writing, when we rapidly state claims and evidence from prior literature.\nPlagiarism can be both un-intentional/accidental or fully intentional - however, the implications of both types are largely the same, and the consequences tend to be equally severe.\nIt is also possible to self-plagiarize. This may seem paradoxical, but the reuse of the same sentences as part of a new work implies that the sentence originated in the new work, when it did not. When submitting graded or publishable work, it is expected that the piece is novel and unique to other work.\nThe two strategies for avoiding plagiarism are to use good paraphrasing and proper APA 7th citations and references. We covered this earlier in our workshop introducing APA style.\n\nAnimal Research\nThis will be less of a focus for this class, but you will need to have some general notions of the nuance in this area. Generally, animals should be used sparingly, and should be treated with the utmost respect for their contributions to studies.\n\nLab animals (those kept explicitly for research purposes) have specific ethic guidelines governing their care, habitat, and treatment.\nLab animals are governed by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), a sort of IRB-for-animals\n3 Rs\n\nReplacements: try to find alternatives to using animals, wherever possible\nRefinement: minimize harm to animals with better, less intrusive lab procedures\nReduction: Try to use as few animals as possible\n\nPublic opinion on animals can be very mixed, and certain advocacy groups seek to outright ban the use of animals in lab studies. However, many also recognize that use of animals is tightly governed (just like with humans) and critical to some areas of research especially dangerous for humans (like early stage clinical trials)."

    "text": "2.1 Areas for Review\n\nEmpirical research does have comparison groups and controls for confounds, which are the desirable traits which separate it from personal experience as a source for information.\n\nThere are multiple causal explanations possible in personal experience, and which of those is true is unknown to us, hence why it is not a reliable source of information for claims.\n\nEmpirical research does reduce the chance of bias in our claims in our knowledge (which is why we use it in the first place), but it does not completely eliminate bias.\n\nRemember the bias blind spot, even researchers have bias and must admit to it.\nIntuition is generally more biased than empirical research (see availability heuristic, etc.)\nResearchers can most certainly be biased in selection of methods and literature.\n\nThe bias blind spot is when a person (falsely) believes they are immune to bias due to scientific training.\n\nCherry-picking evidence is more associated with confirmation bias.\nBeing convinced of a good story is primarily related to narrative bias.\n\nThe three inferior sources of information to empirical research (as discussed in class) are personal experience, authority, and intuition.\nA meta-analysis is a type of literature review article, and can be viewed as a quantitative extension of a literature review\nA confound is something that makes it difficult to determination causation between two or more variables\nThe most important step in assessing an article prior to citing it in your own research is to read the full-text PDF of the article.\n\nIt is not sufficient to just read the abstract or determine whether the researchers are already respected in the field\nRemember those Merton’s Scientific Norms:\n\nAnyway can do research in an area, regardless of their prior status, and we assess claims on methodological merit, rather than the people who conduct it (universalism)"

All modern research must be reviewed by multiple parties tasked with respecting participants and ethics in any given study.\n\nMost studies cannot even be legally conducted before there has been a thorough review of the planned procedures.\n\nIn our proposed research design and procedures, we can never neglect ethical principles.

Instead, its historical significance is that of being the catalyst for a massive research ethics overhaul in the United States, due to its numerous negligent procedures.\nThe study proceeded in intentional secrecy, deceiving both its participants, and the broader American public. The researchers ignored well-founded concerns from whistleblowers and failed to respect the autonomy and well-being of its participants.\n\n\n\n\nThough this was a medical study, the downstream effects and lessons learned from this study are immediately relevant to psychology and all social science research.\n\n\n\n\n\nLessons learned:\n\nParticipants were not treated with respect, autonomy, and dignity. They were deceived, intentionally un-informed of risks and treatments, prevented from finding information that would aid them in making decision about study participation\nParticipants were intimately and immensely harmed. They were allowed to suffer with the effects of the disease, despite the development of valid treatments that would have cured the disease. The study prioritized the possible results over the safety of its participants.\nParticipants were purposefully sampled as members of a vulnerable and oppressed socioeconomic group. The Black men in this study were likely to be poor and have little formal education. Rather than take measures to respect and inform each participant, this was exploited to keep participants unaware."

    "text": "6.2 Milgram’s Obedience Studies\n\nIn summary, Stanley Milgram’s experiments (which came in many variations) were focused on examining how people respond to authoritative commands to inflict punishment and follow orders. These experiments were, in part, born out of questions surrounding obedience of citizens and soldiers in the Nazi regime, in Germany.\n\n\n\n\nParticipants often would have some role in inflicting a perceived pain or punishment on to an actor. No actual harm was actually inflicted to the actor (a confederate), but participants did believe that they were inflicting the pain, usually a shock of some degree. If they pushed back against the demand to administer the punishment (even at extreme levels), an authoritative figure would instruct them to continue over and over.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, the flaw does not lie in harm done to the actor - the shocks weren’t real, and were merely simulated. However, think about the emotional distress in the participants - feeling “forced” by authority to perform inhumane actions.\nThough participants were debriefed at the end of the study and met the actor who assured they were fine - there are questions as to whether they were truly told that those shocks were faked. Some participants worried for weeks.\n\n\n\nLessons learned:\n\nMilgram continued the studies, even after learning a staggering 65% of participants would continue the shocks to the end - usually accompanied by extreme emotional distress of the participants.\nWhile the Tuskegee study showed us physical harm to the participants, this study showed us emotional pain inflicted on the participants. Both are reasonable dangers we must consider in psychological research.\nWas it worth it? Did we learn something so valuable that made it worth the pain those people felt…"

    "section": "7.2 The Belmont Report",
    "text": "7.2 The Belmont Report\nOverview\n\nIn many ways, the Belmont Report is the original and most influential guiding pieces of ethical conduct for any type of human subjects research in the United States.\nThough it is very comprehensive and foundational, it can be summarized by focusing on 3 core principles: Respect for Persons, Beneficence, and Justice. In your future work in the research proposal and article critique, I want you to be very cognizant of these virtues in your writing and reading.\n\nRespect for Persons\n\nConsists of two applications: Autonomy and respect for limited autonomy\nAll people are autonomous. In practice, this means that we allow each person to guide their own participation or non-participation in a study. They are entitled to sufficient knowledge to weigh benefits and risks. A person cannot be coerced, deceived, or offered excessive incentive to obtain consent.\nSome people are limited in autonomy due to outside factors. There are special groups which are, in one way or another, limited in their ability to give informed consent.\n\nExamples: those with intellectual/developmental disability, minors, prisoners, those under a medical guardianship or power-of-attorney.\nIn these cases, researchers must act with additional precautions to protect vulnerable individuals.\nProcedures may involve obtain consent of a guardian and assent of the person under the guardianship.\n\n\nBeneficence\n\nThis principle is critically concerned with minimization of harm and acting in the best interests of participants and the broader population represented by the sample of the study.\nNow, studies may, by virtue of the research questions, require some degree of harm. However, it is absolutely necessary that researchers do their best to anticipate, avoid, and negate harm wherever it may occur.\n\nThis often requires that researchers regularly assess the state of participants and ensure they are not unduly harmed by study procedures. Studies may need to be changed (with approval) or outright stopped if risk of harm grows greater than expected.\n\nWithin this principle, is the necessity of ensuring privacy through completely anonymous studies and/or confidential studies. Harm can come to individuals in information is leaked or shared. Institutions will have strict data policies to protect the information gathered about participants in studies.\n\nJustice\n\nThis principle highlights the importance of considering the larger impact of the study and the potential negative effect on the study participants to achieve such a result.\nWe should avoid using a sample that is convenient or useful by virtue of their position (e.g., those considered “vulnerable” as stated before) to benefit the broader population.\nPut another way, we should be concerned with ensuring that there is equity between the groups under study, and the larger group that benefits from said work."

    "section": "7.3 The APA Ethical Principles",
    "text": "7.3 The APA Ethical Principles\nOverview\n\nThe APA guidelines supplement and apply the Belmont report principles specifically to psychological science and practice. In some ways, it expands and adds further detail to “update” the principals.\n5 core principals (summarized in Table 4.1, pg. 99)\n\nBeneficence and nonmaleficence\nFidelity and responsibility\nIntegrity\nJustice\nRespect for people’s rights and dignity\n\nThese guidelines provide further definition and explanations on a variety of topics, named the Ethical Standards for Research:\n\nInstitutional Review Boards (IRBs)\n\nThe IRB is the central governing body overseeing ethics in research at any given institution. They are responsible for carefully inspecting and evaluating the planned methods of any given study, but especially human subjects studies.\n\nThe IRB often requests extensive documentation on planned studies and procedures well in advance of when they happen. It is not uncommon to have a nearly completed methods section and introduction sections before a study is even approved\nE.g., Neuropsychological Study at Trinity\n\nThey are a key step in approving research, prior to conducting a study. Without IRB approval, a study cannot proceed.\n\nInformed Consent\n\nUnder many studies, a researcher must provide each participant a form that indicates the general goals of the study, likely benefits and risks, as well all procedures for a person to revoke participation.\nRegulation do allow for informed consent to be waived under circumstances, such as when data was already gathered (e.g., census data, electronic health record data from routine care) or when a person could “reasonably expect” to be seen by the general public. However, this waiver must be explicitly asked for and explained.\nIRBs carefully weigh whether a study must employ informed consent forms based on the risk to individuals and data anonymity.\n\nAs with any component of a study, and IRB can request changes or outright force a certain course of actions\n\n\nDeception\n\nIntentional deception and vagueness as part of a study’s methodology are fairly common and can be done ethically, with caveats.\n\nExamples: Milgram’s shocks, confederates (actors), etc.\nLie by leaving information out is called omission where intentionally giving false information is called commission. Deception should only be used to the point that it is absolutely necessary to the goals of the study.\n\nFirst, the deception must be rationalized as necessary to the goals and validity of the study. It must be done intentionally to protect specific goals and threats to the study.\n\nFor example, a participant who knows a study is about implicit bias towards and out-group may act unlike their normal self in order to appear “better”\n\nSecond, this deception must be thoroughly planned and explained to the IRB, with appropriate debrief planned for after completion of the study.\nDeception isn’t a universally loved practice, but many recognize it as a necessary part of studies to isolate psychological effects from bias in participants.\n\nDebriefing\n\nDebriefing sessions occur with participant after their participation in the study, in which the methods used are explained, and any deception is revealed.\nResearchers may share results with people, so they are aware of findings, and can possibly benefit from the research. Functionally, we debrief for the same reason we share full procedures in published work: to increase trust in the process and science.\n\nResearch Misconduct\n\nThis term is mostly related to the deadly practices of Data fabrication and/or falsification.\nFabrication: When data is created to support certain conclusions\nFalsification: When data is selectively pruned, filtered, or treated to bias it towards favorable conclusions. This is also relevant when procedures are use that bias participants in their reactions.\nBoth of these acts of research misconduct may have wide and longstanding effects on professional careers of researchers, as well as public effects\n\nThe original study on ASD and vaccines is retracted! But its effects are still pervasive to this day…\n\n\nOpenness and Transparency\n\nAs a general rule, one should readily share the procedures, analyses, and data used to complete research (see Merton’s openness norm) - unless to share these would jeopardize the security and privacy of subjects.\n\nNot all data sharing is allowed by certain organizations - sometimes this decision is somewhat out of the researcher’s hands\n\nPre-registered hypotheses, data sharing agreements, and code-sharing can all be helpful practices to allow research practices to be better inspected by interested parties. It can also be useful in catching small errors, leading to corrections or retractions when necessary.\n\nPlagiarism\n\nPlagiarism is said to be passing another person’s work or words off as your own. It is especially easy to do in research writing, when we rapidly state claims and evidence from prior literature.\nPlagiarism can be both un-intentional/accidental or fully intentional - however, the implications of both types are largely the same, and the consequences tend to be equally severe.\nIt is also possible to self-plagiarize. This may seem paradoxical, but the reuse of the same sentences as part of a new work implies that the sentence originated in the new work, when it did not. When submitting graded or publishable work, it is expected that the piece is novel and unique to other work.\nThe two strategies for avoiding plagiarism are to use good paraphrasing and proper APA 7th citations and references. We covered this earlier in our workshop introducing APA style.\n\nAnimal Research\nThis will be less of a focus for this class, but you will need to have some general notions of the nuance in this area. Generally, animals should be used sparingly, and should be treated with the utmost respect for their contributions to studies.\n\nLab animals (those kept explicitly for research purposes) have specific ethic guidelines governing their care, habitat, and treatment.\nLab animals are governed by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), a sort of IRB-for-animals\n3 Rs\n\nReplacements: try to find alternatives to using animals, wherever possible\nRefinement: minimize harm to animals with better, less intrusive lab procedures\nReduction: Try to use as few animals as possible\n\nPublic opinion on animals can be very mixed, and certain advocacy groups seek to outright ban the use of animals in lab studies. However, many also recognize that use of animals is tightly governed (just like with humans) and critical to some areas of research especially dangerous for humans (like early stage clinical trials)."

A weaker claim requires less robust evidence."

Good sampling will always help the meaning and impact of research.\nBut, like all validities, we must balance maximizing generalizability with the practical limits on our resources and time\nIn my opinion, the most important factor is that researchers transparently report on the limits of their sampling and are realistically in what this means for the impact of their research."

    "text": "6.1 Bias in Intuition\n\nRecall that intuition is often like a “hunch” or a “gut feeling”. We may describe intuition as being “pre-scientific.”\nUnfortunately, our intuition may be swayed by certain sources of bias in how we think…\n\nConvincing Narratives\n\nHave you ever met someone who could really sell a story? Maybe a friend who is really good at making stuff up or a salesperson.\nFreud certainly could! Many of his early theories drew on observations that seemed reasonable enough, and his psychoanalytic theory is prevalent to this day.\n\nThis is a sort of “just-makes-sense” thought process, where we think - “well, naturally, it works that way”\n\nDiscuss: can you think of any good stories that turned out to be false?\nHowever, this intuition can be an incorrect assumption (see Scared Straight program) and may prevent us from fully exploring whether things are actually as we think they are\n\nAvailability Heuristic\n\nAnyone afraid of shark attacks in the ocean?\nYou may think that they happen often, but really, they are exceedingly rare. But because of popular media and news hype, the idea of shark attacks is much more readily available cognitively\nA heuristic is just a cognitive shortcut, it allows us to skip the process of thinking to come to conclusion. However, in the scientific theory-data-hypothesis cycle, it threatens to obscure what is actually going on\nThis heuristic often causes over- or under- estimations of certain situations occurring\n\nPresent/Present Bias\n\nThe present/present bias may be best understood as an extension of failing to account for comparison groups (see No Comparison)\n\nIf we don’t see a possible outcome, do we fully account for it? Remember Harlow’s monkeys’ third option…\n\nThis may be understood as also reflecting a tendency to recall certain (critical) events, but not others\n\n\nConfirmation Bias\n\nThis is our tendency to protect our already closely-held beliefs by selectively praising, criticizing, and noticing information that reinforces the belief\n\nEspecially relevant to situations like politics, where people have a great motivation to protect “their” perspectives\n\nThis often causes extreme bias in evidence-gathering and is likely to lead to a single conclusion: “I’m right”\nExample:\n\nGoogle search: “Evidence that the earth is flat” vs.\n“Evidence of the earth’s shape”\n\n\nBias Blind Spot\n\nRecall those last few examples of bias? You are just as susceptible to those same fallacies as anyone else.\nIt pays dividends to be humble and curious towards possibilities, even when our intuition, experiences, and even research may say otherwise.\nEspecially as scientists, there is a temptation to believe we are uniquely resistant to bias, we aren’t\n\nWant to eliminate bias? Prove it with sound science, methods, and reporting"

We must compare our study results to some other benchmark, whether that is a control group (no intervention) or another type of intervention.\nWithout a comparison group we have three possible outcomes:\n\nOur effect is lesser than control (no intervention) or other interventions\nOur effect is equal to control or other interventions\nOur effect is greater than control or other interventions\n\nExample: A researcher performs a social intervention to reduce feeling of hostility towards an “out-group”. It seems like the participants don’t harbor any major negative feelings towards the out-group at the end of the study. A success!? Maybe…\n\nDiscuss: Why are the conclusions wrong here? What could we compare the social intervention group against?\n\nYou may have some belief about the value of an intervention (from personal experience), but you won’t have evidence of its “real” effect, without a comparison group."

What other explanations are possible?\n\nBecause of confounds, there may be these possibilities as well:\n\nThe professor had a rough day at home and it taking it out on students (unfairly)\nYou forgot your first assignment, and were late\nThe professor has mistaken you for a different student\nAny number of other possibilities!\n\nIn our own lives it is difficult to impossible to isolate individual causes for certain outcomes, but in research, we have procedural and statistical controls"

There are exceptions/edge cases to all hypotheses and, as we mentioned in the last lecture, we cannot account for all possible scenarios with a single study.\nResearch is always probabilistic which means it try to capture the majority of experiences or the net average of all cases\n\nWhich may mean your experiences may contradict the weight of evidence in the research body - but that doesn’t mean that your experience or the research consensus is “wrong”\n\nConnect to your previous statistics class: conclusions are based on p-values, which, in turn, are essentially a probability of a certain outcome.\nA single case does not fully invalidate a theory or hypothesis. Instead, it may represent a unique case that differs in some way than the others."

    "text": "6.1 Bias in Intuition\n\nRecall that intuition is often like a “hunch” or a “gut feeling”. We may describe intuition as being “pre-scientific.”\nUnfortunately, our intuition may be swayed by certain sources of bias in how we think…\n\nConvincing Narratives\n\nHave you ever met someone who could really sell a story? Maybe a friend who is really good at making stuff up or a salesperson.\nFreud certainly could! Many of his early theories drew on observations that seemed reasonable enough, and his psychoanalytic theory is prevalent to this day.\n\nThis is a sort of “just-makes-sense” thought process, where we think - “well, naturally, it works that way”\n\nDiscuss: can you think of any good stories that turned out to be false?\nHowever, this intuition can be an incorrect assumption (see Scared Straight program) and may prevent us from fully exploring whether things are actually as we think they are\n\nAvailability Heuristic\n\nAnyone afraid of shark attacks in the ocean?\nYou may think that they happen often, but really, they are exceedingly rare. But because of popular media and news hype, the idea of shark attacks is much more readily available cognitively\nA heuristic is just a cognitive shortcut, it allows us to skip the process of thinking to come to conclusion. However, in the scientific theory-data-hypothesis cycle, it threatens to obscure what is actually going on\nThis heuristic often causes over- or under- estimations of certain situations occurring\n\nPresent/Present Bias\n\nThe present/present bias may be best understood as an extension of failing to account for comparison groups (see No Comparison)\n\nIf we don’t see a possible outcome, do we fully account for it? Remember Harlow’s monkeys’ third option…\n\nThis may be understood as also reflecting a tendency to recall certain (critical) events, but not others\n\n\nConfirmation Bias\n\nThis is our tendency to protect our already closely-held beliefs by selectively praising, criticizing, and noticing information that reinforces the belief\n\nEspecially relevant to situations like politics, where people have a great motivation to protect “their” perspectives\n\nThis often causes extreme bias in evidence-gathering and is likely to lead to a single conclusion: “I’m right”\nExample:\n\nGoogle search: “Evidence that the earth is flat” vs.\n“Evidence of the earth’s shape”\n\n\nBias Blind Spot\n\nRecall those last few examples of bias? You are just as susceptible to those same fallacies as anyone else.\nIt pays dividends to be humble and curious towards possibilities, even when our intuition, experiences, and even research may say otherwise.\nEspecially as scientists, there is a temptation to believe we are uniquely resistant to bias, we aren’t\n\nWant to eliminate bias? Prove it with sound science, methods, and reporting"

It isn’t just because the researchers are “published”, but rather, that the peer-review process is well set up to prevent poor science from slipping through\n\nTherefore, we must interrogate the method by which a person comes to a conclusion, rather than basing our opinion of the person.

Usually contains some form of introduction, methods, results, and discussion.\nLiterature Review Journal Articles: A comprehensive literature review that summarizes, synthesizes, and compounds the many available empirical studies in a specific research area. Often, comes across as an extended introduction section.\n\nAlso, a great starting point when doing a literature review for your own study!\n\nMeta-analysis: An extension of a literature review articles that calculates a composite effect size from the surveyed research study. A more quantitative version of a classic literature review.\n\n(Edited) Books\n\nScientific Books: a full-length scientific book written by the same single or multiple authors throughout. Focuses on a single topic, and functions as a sort of extended literature review.\nEdited Books: a collaborative effort in which many experts compose chapters on specific topics. These are usually not peer-reviewed to the same extent as journal articles - but the authors are usually some of the most respected researchers in an area. Be careful of appeal to authority because of this!\n\nThese are popular among applied practitioners of psychology (consumers), because it allows them to keep up with developments and ideas in a nice range of areas."
