Results indicate a moderate effect of the treatment in reducing depression in the present study. Future research is needed to clarify the effect in different populations and contexts.”\nPut statistically: we never prove or disprove our null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)), we just supply evidence for or against our alternative hypothesis (\\(H_1\\))\nOnly once many studies have provided support for a theory, can we say the weight of evidence is in favor of it."

We must perform an empirical experiment!\nExample: Harry Harlow was interested in attachment theory (broad idea set - theory) gave a young monkey two options: cling to a “wire mother” with food, or a “cloth mother” with fur and warmth. He hypothesized that them monkey would prefer the cloth mother (concrete prediction - hypothesis). He found that monkeys generally preferred the clothe mother (concrete outcome - data )\nThis also shows the falsifiability of good research - we must be willing to be wrong (i.e., we provide the possibility that the experiment can go the “other way”)\nBut, this one study does not singularly define attachment theory, the weight of evidence requires more studies!"

We question things, not to simply be contrarian, but because we must understand the faults in existing knowledge.\n\nExample: I strongly believe the MMPI to be a valid measure of personality, but I read a study that is critical of its accuracy."

Or, others can also disagree and provide competing evidence in their own work.\n\nA theory is not crafted from the work of just one author, but instead the synthesis of many different published articles\nIn psychological science we use APA style (in its 7th edition) to reference previous scientific work\n\nJournals may range in quality and rigor though! We will discuss some nuances in this later in the semester\nAlso, some journals may be difficult to access, but there are many ways we may use the library resources to access the texts\n\nBy the end of this semester, you should be very familiar with what a peer-reviewed publication looks like."

Results indicate a moderate effect of the treatment in reducing depression in the present study. Future research is needed to clarify the effect in different populations and contexts.”\nPut statistically: we never prove or disprove our null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)), we just supply evidence for or against our alternative hypothesis (\\(H_1\\))\nOnly once many studies have provided support for a theory, can we say the weight of evidence is in favor of it."

    "text": "3.7 We Can be Wrong\n\nFalsifiability: Good research must allow for our theory and/or hypothesis to be flawed or erroneous. If this is not accounted for, we engage in confirmation bias, or effectively choosing to only investigate for our views.\n\nRecall the Theory-Hypothesis-Data flowchart from earlier. Revision is a valid outcome of new data !\n\nIt is critical that our design, statistics, and reporting make clear the possibility that a study is limited in its scope and abilities\nNo one study is so perfectly designed that it can account for all edge cases in a phenomenon"

    "text": "3.8 Example of Theory-Hypothesis-Data: Harlow’s Monkeys\n\nHow do we test a component of primate attachment theory? We must perform an empirical experiment!\nExample: Harry Harlow was interested in attachment theory (broad idea set - theory) gave a young monkey two options: cling to a “wire mother” with food, or a “cloth mother” with fur and warmth. He hypothesized that them monkey would prefer the cloth mother (concrete prediction - hypothesis). He found that monkeys generally preferred the clothe mother (concrete outcome - data )\nThis also shows the falsifiability of good research - we must be willing to be wrong (i.e., we provide the possibility that the experiment can go the “other way”)\nBut, this one study does not singularly define attachment theory, the weight of evidence requires more studies!"

    "text": "3.9 Norms for Scientific Research\n\nRobert Merton proposed a set of scientific norms that can and should guide our actions and behaviors in approaching and conducting research\nUniversalism states that “science is for everyone” and that claims are not based solely upon the expertise or stature of the scientist, but rather, their methodology and rigor\n\nExample: an undergraduate student can perform research the same as a doctoral student, and it will be measured by its strength, not the person who made is\n\nCommunality is the concept that science is done in a community and as a collective, not only a small group of individuals.\n\nExample: Even the authors of a published paper cite many others in their writing.\n\nDisinterestedness states that we must be guided by a commitment to truth and accurate knowledge, not by monetary gain or pushing of a particular ideology.\n\nExample: A prominent medical scientist publishes results about concerning side effects of a drug, despite the fact that they have stock in the pharmaceutical producing the drug.\n\nOrganized Skepticism says we must commit ourselves to be critical of everything, even ourselves ! We question things, not to simply be contrarian, but because we must understand the faults in existing knowledge.\n\nExample: I strongly believe the MMPI to be a valid measure of personality, but I read a study that is critical of its accuracy."

Or, others can also disagree and provide competing evidence in their own work.\n\nA theory is not crafted from the work of just one author, but instead the synthesis of many different published articles\nIn psychological science we use APA style (in its 7th edition) to reference previous scientific work\n\nJournals may range in quality and rigor though! We will discuss some nuances in this later in the semester\nAlso, some journals may be difficult to access, but there are many ways we may use the library resources to access the texts\n\nBy the end of this semester, you should be very familiar with what a peer-reviewed publication looks like."
