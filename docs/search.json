    "text": "1 Prompt\nYou are working in a clinic with a clinical psychologist who is currently doing additional training in psychotherapeutic, non-medication treatment (i.e., talk therapy) of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). As part of this training, they have started gathering citations to read in order broaden their understanding of this topic. However, they’ve been extremely busy and unable to start reading all of these sources yet. They’ve asked you to screen each of these articles and assess whether they seem to be on-topic and useful in understanding the therapy for this disorder. As part of your screening process, they would like you to write some brief summaries and give a determination of whether it is relevant - in the form of an annotated bibliography.\nAn annotated bibliography looks similar to the “References” section of any APA-style paper. However, with an annotated bibliography, each citation also contains a summary and brief analysis of the content of the article. This is a useful step in the literature review process, in order to sift through the articles you have found and see if they really are relevant to the topic you are interested in. You can learn more about annotated bibliographies with this link. You will primarily be looking through the discussion and abstract sections of these articles to gleam the main points, but you should fully read each paper before summarizing.\nYou do not have to find references for this homework - I have already provided a full list in the References List section of this document, and you may copy that over to your own work (make sure to double-check that formatting is correct in your final work though!). Instead, your goals are to 1) locate the full-text PDF of each article, 2) attempt to read and summarize each article, 3) make a determination on whether this article is relevant to this topic.\nI have verified that each of the listed articles does have a full-text copy available via GVSU library access - make sure you use the resources we discussed in-class! Remember that the easiest way to access these resources is on the GVSU Library Psychology Subject Guide.\nYou are to fully read each of the 10 provided sources, and arrange them into an APA 7 annotated bibliography which contains:\n\nAttach the full-text PDF for each citation (10 total) to the assignment submission.\nProvide at least 3 sentences of summary for each citation\nWrite at least 1 sentences describing whether you think this is appropriate for the clinical psychologist to read, given the Prompt.\n\nWarning: I have intentionally included one or more sources in the provided list that I don’t think is appropriate to this topic. Make sure to consider carefully whether each source is aligned with the topic or not.\n\n\n2 Checklist\n Assignment is formatted as an APA 7 annotated bibliography, as described here\n Each citation has a full-text PDF attached with the assignment submission\n Each citation has at least 3 sentences of summary as an annotation\n Each citation has at least 1 sentence indicating your thoughts as to whether this is appropriate to the topic of the Prompt\n All citations contain the full reference information for the article including: authors, year of publication, title of paper, journal name, volume number, issue number, page numbers\n References are all in APA 7 format, including double-spacing and hanging indent\n References are arranged alphabetically according the first author’s last name\n\n\n3 References List"

    "text": "1 Prompt\nYou are working for a consulting company specializing in assessing workplace satisfaction of people working in office environments (i.e., “white-collar” work). Your supervisor wants to earn an upcoming government grant, but the grant proposal requires scientific sources cited in support of your work and ideas. Your boss is not a scientist by training and doesn’t know how to find any relevant articles - but they know you had some training in this!\nThe grant is specifically designed for supporting projects that, “aim to evaluate workplace satisfaction in high-intensity jobs that are historically prone to burn-out and poor mental health.” Examples of high-intensity jobs might include firefighting, military, police, medical, high-stakes finance or computing, etc. You need to track down scientific, peer-reviewed, and published articles relevant to this topic, so that you can demonstrate an ability to do a literature review, which is an important skill for grant writing.\nYou must find at least 10 peer-reviewed sources related to this topic, which are published in academic journals. Of these 10 citations, at least 3 must be literature reviews/meta-analyses, and at least 3 must be original empirical articles. The remaining 4 may be of any type. All articles must be related to the focus of this grant. Please present all 10 citations in an APA 7-formatted bibliography. You do not have to write anything further than just the citation information itself.\nAs a reminder, I strongly recommend you start searching with the databases listed on the GVSU Library Psychology Subject Guide.\n\n\n2 Checklist\n At least 10 sources cited\n At least 3 sources are literature reviews / meta-analyses\n At least 3 sources are original empirical articles\n All citations are relevant to the goals of the grant, as stated above in the Prompt\n All citations contain the full reference information for the article including: authors, year of publication, title of paper, journal name, volume number, issue number, page numbers\n References are all in APA 7 format, including double-spacing and hanging indent\n References are arranged alphabetically according the first author’s last name"
