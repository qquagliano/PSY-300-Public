Prepare for class periods to last the entirety of the scheduled course time. In-person classes will not be recorded, but some materials will be available to students who may have missed a class period due to excused absences (see [Attendence] and <a href="#due-dates">Due Dates</a>).</p>
<p>Outside of class, students should work diligently and efficiently on assigned coursework. <strong>Textbook readings, as indicated on the <a href="#schedule">Schedule</a>, are always required and not optional.</strong> The readings will be tested upon and are essential for being prepared for content during the class period. I also require you submit your textbook notes for a subset of the chapters (i.e., “<a href="#reading-evidence">Reading Evidence</a>”) In this course, my lectures and the assigned readings will be closely linked and should be viewed as complimentary to each other. I will ensure lectures cover the key content from each chapter. We only meet once every week, so students are expected to manage their own time well, and to finish all assignments in advance of the deadlines provided in the <a href="#schedule">Schedule</a>.</p>

<p>This course is subject to the general GVSU policies listed at <a href="http://www.gvsu.edu/coursepolicies/" class="uri">http://www.gvsu.edu/coursepolicies/</a>. Please review all content on that webpage in addition to what is written here. If you have questions or concern about any of these policies, please contact me.</p>
<section id="contacting-me" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="contacting-me">Contacting Me</h2>
<p>Prior to contacting me, please review this syllabus, relevant assignment sheets, and presentations and make sure the answer you seek is not already there first. While I always invite questions and communication, I ask that you are discerning in using your available resources first.</p>
<p>If you do need to reach out, refer to my <a href="#contact-information">Contact Information</a>. <strong>Please prioritize using email, and include your full name, course number, and section number in the subject line, as well as a description of what you need help with</strong>. An example would be:</p>
<p>“Re: Riley Quagliano, PSY-300 Section 10, SPSS Help for Assignment 2”</p>
<p>Be thorough in your email and tell me what resources you have already used to try to address your concerns. Detail is helpful so that I am able to fully understand and attend to your concern. I am generally able to send responses within 24 hours during weekdays, but please allow me up to 48 hours to respond. If I haven’t responded within 48 hours (during weekdays), please send me a remainder email - I promise I am not ignoring you! If you email me during the weekend or later on a Friday, I cannot guarantee a response any earlier than Monday.</p>
<p>Of course, you are always welcome to ask to schedule a video chat or office visit, or just stop by during my listed office hours - I’m happy to receive visitors for questions about the course or to chat about other things. I usually hang around campus after the scheduled course time, so you may catch me after class for shorter conversations.</p>

<section id="integrity-plagiarism-academic-dishonesty" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="integrity-plagiarism-academic-dishonesty">Integrity, Plagiarism, &amp; Academic Dishonesty</h2>
<p>This course will challenge students to grow skills in responsible and ethical research, in which one of the most essential abilities is writing in a way that gives proper attribution and credit. When drafting a paper, presentation, report, or any type of assignment we <strong>must</strong> take care to use our own words and thoughts, and cite the scholars that we build from. In the academic world, plagiarism, fabrication, and confabulation are some of the most egregious crimes, and have resulted in de-funding of labs, loss of grants, and the destruction of professional reputations.</p>
<p>I will hold students to the same high standards of the professional research world, as I wish to ensure all of you are able to leave this course confident in your ability to conduct and write ethical research. I will help all students steadily build these skills, and do expect early mistakes that need correction. However, any evidence of intentional or negligent plagiarism or academic dishonesty will be handled in line with the GVSU Student Code.</p>
<p>As described by the GVSU Student Code, “Offering the work of someone else as one’s own is plagiarism…” “Any ideas or material taken from another source for either written or oral presentation must be fully acknowledged.” “Depending on the instructor’s judgment of the particular case, he/she may … give a failing grade for the … entire course.” Simply rearranging the words or substituting synonyms in the original source is still plagiarism. Details about the APA method for citing research will be provided during the course. Furthermore, students should not self-plagiarize, that is, reuse their own work from another course.</p>
<p>Students are permitted to be in study groups and learn from one another, but all submitted work should be distinct and unique to each individual. I would recommend you only study in groups for quizzes or exams, but complete other work (e.g., Article Critique, Research Proposal, etc.) as an individual, to avoid unintentional plagiarism. Students in other sections of this course, with other professors, may not have perfectly aligned content with the pace of this section.</p>

<section id="use-of-ai-tools" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="use-of-ai-tools">Use of AI Tools</h2>
<p>The following statement should be understood as constituting my policy on use of AI tools in this course:</p>
<p>AI Policy Statement by David A. Joyner (<a href="mailto:davidjoyner@fediscience.org">davidjoyner@fediscience.org</a>)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“We treat AI-based assistance, such as ChatGPT and Copilot, the same way we treat collaboration with other people: you are welcome to talk about your ideas and work with other people, both inside and outside the class, as well as with AI-based assistants.</p>
<p>However, all work you submit must be your own. You should never include in your assignment anything that was not written directly by you without proper citation (including quotation marks and in-line citation for direct quotes).</p>
<p>Including anything you did not write in your assignment without proper citation will be treated as an academic misconduct case. If you are unsure where the line is between collaborating with AI and copying from AI, we recommend the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Never hit “Copy” within your conversation with an AI assistant. You can copy your own work into your conversation, but do not copy anything from the conversation back into your assignment. Instead, use your interaction with the AI assistant as a learning experience, then let your assignment reflect your improved understanding.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not have your assignment and the AI agent open at the same time. Similar to above, use your conversation with the AI as a learning experience, then close the interaction down, open your assignment, and let your assignment reflect your revised knowledge. This includes avoiding using AI directly integrated into your composition environment: just as you should not let a classmate write content directly into your submission, so also avoid using tools that directly add content to your submission.”</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>While “AI”, as we know it, may be a useful tool for learning and troubleshooting, it is never an acceptable replacement for graded and professional work. For the work in this course, I’d strongly recommend you rely upon class content, the textbook, and peer-reviewed scientific research to study and build your skills. If I have reason to believe that AI tools have been used to generate work passed off as your own, I will investigate it the same as any other form of academic dishonesty (see <a href="#integrity-plagiarism-academic-dishonesty">Integrity, Plagiarism, &amp; Academic Dishonesty</a>). I implore you to maintain a high level of integrity in your work and I will take appropriate measures to detect and investigate unethical use of AI tools.</p>
</section>
<section id="respectful-and-inclusive-environment" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="respectful-and-inclusive-environment">Respectful and Inclusive Environment</h2>
<p>All students, in all their virtual and physical interactions with myself and one another, are expected to treat each other in a mindful and professional manner. Please be respectful of your classmates’ diverse identities, backgrounds, and beliefs. Even in disagreements or tense discussion, students should remain constructive in their arguments, and not personally attack one another. If at any point you feel that another student has acted maliciously, aggressively, or disrespectful towards you, please notify me immediately, so I may address it. Additionally, if you have concern about my own conduct, please do let me know so, I can correct it. Those that continue to act in a way that is harmful to the classroom environment may be dismissed from the course and referred to college administration for further discipline.</p>
</section>
<section id="electronic-devices" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="electronic-devices">Electronic Devices</h2>
<p>Students are permitted to use computers or other devices to take notes and complete assignments during the class period. In fact, I encourage you to bring internet-capable devices to our class meetings, as they will likely be helpful in certain in-class activities and quizzes. However, refrain from doing any activities during class that distract those around you (e.g., watching videos, playing video games, listening to music, distracting loud keyboards, etc.) If I suspect that you are harming the learning experience of other students, I will ask you to either cease the behavior or switch to pen-and-paper for note-taking. Please ensure all electronic devices are silenced during class (medical devices that must alert for the well-being of the user are exempt). Regardless of whether you intend on using an electronic device for class, I’d recommend having a pen/pencil and paper, in case a device crashes or is out of battery.</p>
</section>
<section id="food-and-drink" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="food-and-drink">Food and Drink</h2>
<p>It is fine to eat and drink during the class period (except for during exams and quizzes), as long as you are able to do so quietly and without interrupting others. Please do not make a mess, as to be respectful to those who diligently clean our rooms.</p>
</section>
<section id="course-materials-and-recordings" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="course-materials-and-recordings">Course Materials and Recordings</h2>
<p>For any materials created by me, such as notes, slides, handouts, assignments, etc. - do not share these materials with students who are not in the section, now or in the future. You may keep them for your own personal reference. I cannot allow students to keep copies of exams or quizzes, even after they are graded. Resources that I provide that are already public or semi-public, like articles and webpages, are fine to share with anyone.</p>
<p>Class periods will not be recorded by me, nor are students permitted to record the class lecture with any form of video, audio, or transcription equipment. I will provide a separate recording of the lecture(s), as well as accompanying slides, for any given class meeting <em>after</em> the class meeting it compliments. These materials are provided to help students review the lecture content, if you believe there is something you may have missed during the class period. <strong>The posted lecture recording and slides are NOT a substitute for being in class at the designated meeting time - as you will miss important in-class discussions and activities, if you are not present.</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="attendance" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="attendance">Attendance</h2>
<p>Please try to make it to class, on time, for all scheduled class periods. Coming in late may disrupt your peers’ learning and my ability to lecture. It is difficult to keep up with the course content if you miss part of or all of the class. While I understand that life circumstances may force you to miss class or be late on occasion, it will likely impair your ability to succeed in this course. If you suspect attendance will be consistently difficult for you in this course, I would suggest that you consider leaving this section. If you expect to miss a class period, or do so due to an emergency, please reach out to me to make up work (see more details in <a href="#due-dates">Due Dates</a>).</p>
</section>
<section id="due-dates" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="due-dates">Due Dates</h2>
<p><strong>All due dates, as they are listed in the schedule, are firm.</strong> You should closely track your own progress in the course and ensure that you are keeping on pace. You should plan to make every attempt to attend our regularly scheduled course times so that you may complete any necessary assessments. Take-home assignments are due at the start of class time.</p>
<p>If you expect that a qualifying pre-existing obligation, that cannot be moved, will interfere with class time, please reach out to me <strong>at least one week prior to the affected course meeting.</strong> So that we may make arrangements for you to turn in relevant work, and take any missed <a href="#quizzes">Quizzes</a> or <a href="#exams">Exams</a>. If you find yourself in an emergency situation that prevents your attendance in class/turning in work on time, please notify me as soon as possible and provide documentation on what your emergency was (e.g., doctor’s note).</p>
<p>I will work with students to ensure you have the opportunity to submit your work and make it up. <strong>Barring extraordinary circumstances, you must reach out to me within 48 hours of the original due date to coordinate an appropriate time to submit the work.</strong></p>
<p>In the cases of missed work needing to be made up, I ask that we complete the work prior to the next class period as to not delay review of exams or quizzes for your peers. <strong>It is the student’s responsibility to contact me regarding make-up work - failure to do so in a timely manner (48 hrs) will result in the total forfeiture of points.</strong></p>
<p>Barring exemptions, as explained above, late work will have 25% of earned points deducted per each day late (including weekends). Work is considered to be a day late immediately after submission for assignments at the start of the class period. Example: a paper (50 points total) is submitted 2 days late, and earns 40/50 points - this paper will have 50% of earned points deducted, resulting in a 20/50. Thus, after 4 days late, an assignment will not be eligible for any points.</p>
<p>Please submit all assignments through their respective <a href="#blackboard-ultra">Blackboard Ultra</a> submissions, regardless of whether they are late or not. Do not email me or hand in paper copies of assignments unless I request so - I will redirect you to submit through Blackboard.</p>

<section id="changes-to-the-syllabus-and-schedule" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="changes-to-the-syllabus-and-schedule">Changes to the Syllabus and Schedule</h2>
<p>It is plausible that events during the semester may require that I modify the syllabus or schedule. As soon as I know such a change must be made, I will notify you all through Blackboard and those messages should be understood as amending this document.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="blackboard-ultra" class="level1">
<h1>Blackboard Ultra</h1>
<p>I will be making liberal use of Blackboard Ultra to communicate, administer assignments, and share course materials. Please make sure you have a working knowledge of this platform and can reasonably navigate it to find messages and submit assignments. You should have access to an e-learning Blackboard tutorial course that can show you the basic functions. I will try to use Blackboard to keep you all engaged during the weeks and provide additional resources to those who are interested. Prior to the course starting, please browse around and make sure you can access and view everything alright. I will attempt to keep information between this syllabus and schedule, and Blackboard as congruent as possible. If you experience technical problems with Blackboard or are not able to get things working in your browser, contact the help desk:</p>

</section>
<section id="grading" class="level1">
<h1>Grading</h1>
<p>Summative assessment (i.e., graded assignments) are key to evaluating a student’s success in learning the content of this course. I have set up this course to be forgiving for the sake of learning, as mistakes and missteps are often part of the growth process. However, I must fairly evaluate the abilities each student builds in this course, and must ensure that the learning objectives are met. That being said, I care deeply about the effort and motivation that you have put into this course and have included assignments that award points for good-faith attempts and offer room for improvement. My goal is to readily submit grades on <a href="#blackboard-ultra">Blackboard Ultra</a> as I complete them, so that you may be well-informed to your current status. All grade functions on Blackboard should be fully set-up so that you can easily track your progress and success.</p>
<p><strong>I cannot and will not “bump”, “curve”, “round”, or “scale” grades at the individual student level, due to any circumstance. Please do not ask me to do this.</strong> Such a change in student’s grades can lead to unfairness and subjectivity in how students are assessed, and would be unfair to your peers. In the case of an error in grading or poor class performance on a test question, I will consider the need to drop questions or adjust grading for all students equally. The standard for what constitutes certain letter grades (e.g., A, A-, B, etc.) in this course will be presented in this syllabus, and is subject to (downward) change if I feel it is necessary.</p>
<p>I will provide an accurate breakdown of the sources of points, and students are expected to monitor their own success throughout the term. If your performance is below what you would like at any point, please talk to me (see <a href="#contacting-me">Contacting Me</a>) or make use of the <a href="#additional-resources">Additional Resources</a>. Please make early adjustments to avoid any last minute issues that prevent you from obtaining the success you’d like.</p>
<p>It is to the advantage of you, the student, that many points are possible in this course. That way, a few poor performances can be made up by consistent effort on the other available opportunities. The point ranges are approximations of the percents - please note your final letter grade will be determined solely by the percent range it falls in. If I remove quiz or exam questions or change the point total at any point, the point ranges will no longer properly apply.</p>

<section id="activity-types" class="level1">
<h1>Activity Types</h1>
<p>I use a variety of activities as a source of points for your grade in this course. This way, I can assess your skill in many domains and mediums and can help you build a well-rounded skill set.</p>
<section id="introductions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introductions">Introductions</h2>
<p>At the start of the semester, I ask that you all contribute to a Blackboard discussion board, so your classmates and I may learn a little bit about all of you. Please tell us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name (with phonemic spelling if you think it would help with pronunciation) and pronouns (optional - only if you feel comfortable)</li>
<li>Your year in school (e.g., First-year, sophomore, etc.)</li>
<li>Your majors and minors</li>
<li>Briefly identify one area of research in psychology you find interesting - it can be mundane or complex, broad or specific, just throw something out there.</li>
<li>Explain one or two interesting facts or hobbies of yours - share anything you’d like!</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="reading-evidence" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reading-evidence">Reading Evidence</h2>
<p>For any 5 chapter readings (out of 14) in the textbook, please submit your notes that you take during your reading of the chapter. Your notes can be handwritten or typed, and can be in whatever format and style best suits your needs as a student. I just ask that you are comprehensive and thorough to the content of the chapter and cover all the sections to some degree. I may make suggestions on areas for improvement, but will generally award full points if you make a good faith attempt to cover all the content. It is recommended to do at least some of these during early chapters, so I may suggest strategies that I think will serve you well for the remainder of the semester. I do this so that you may be set up for success in note-taking to best serve you in this course, while also rewarding your dialogue with the reading.</p>
<p>Of course, I <strong>strongly</strong> recommend that you take good notes for all chapters, not just the 5 ones you submit. They may aid you greatly in the open-note quizzes and preparation on the exams.</p>
</section>
<section id="exams" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="exams">Exams</h2>
<p>There will be 2 exams in this course. These exams are intended to be cumulative and will cover content from all prior units and <a href="#quizzes">Quizzes</a>. Much of the knowledge in this course is naturally cumulative, so it benefits you to review content from the previous units. However, the majority of test content will come from the most recent unit, with fewer questions being dedicated to the prior unit. The format is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each exam is 50 multiple-choice questions, 2 points for each question</li>
<li>Exams will be taken at the start of the class period, but after the quiz review for the prior week. They will be taken on paper scantron sheets.</li>
<li>Exams will contain content from the entire unit, between lectures AND readings</li>
<li>Exams are timed, 113 minutes only (previously was 75 minutes)</li>
<li>Exams are not open-note, open-book, or collaborative. You are not permitted to use any form of assistance to aid you during the tests. Do not discuss the tests with other students after it has concluded</li>
<li>Quizzes and exam will be ended early if all students are clearly finished and content with their answers</li>
<li>Exams will be graded promptly and reviewed the following week</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="quizzes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="quizzes">Quizzes</h2>
<p>We will be taking quizzes routinely throughout the semester to help cement the concepts between each class period. For each student, I will drop each student’s lowest 2 quiz grades from your final grade. The format is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each quiz is 10 multiple-choice questions, 1 point for each question</li>
<li>Quizzes will be taken at the start of the class period on the Blackboard LMS</li>
<li>Quizzes will be on content covered in the previous lecture and the associated reading for that lecture</li>
<li>Quizzes are timed, 23 minutes only (previously was 15 minutes)</li>
<li>Quizzes are open-note and open-book, that is, you are allowed to use those resources during the quizzes. Thus, they reward good structure in thoughtfulness in your notes and preparation (see <a href="#stay-organized">Stay Organized</a>)</li>
<li>You may not collaborate with others during the quizzes, or discuss questions with other students after the quiz. You cannot use AI tools or the internet to help you.</li>
<li>Quizzes and exam will be ended early if all students are clearly finished and content with their answers</li>
<li>Quizzes will be graded promptly and reviewed the following week</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of the fast nature of quizzes, you will not have time to look up answers to each of questions - please prepare by studying, reviewing, and understanding the content, using your organized notes and book as a quick backup.</p>
</section>
<section id="research-proposal" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="research-proposal">Research Proposal</h2>
<p>This will be one of the most critical and important assignments in the course. You will be asked to generate an original research proposal that is ethical, well-designed, and rooted in a mature understanding of the scientific literature. This project will use many of the skills that you build throughout this course and should reflect a strong understanding of your capabilities as a budding researcher. We will discuss this project more after the first few weeks and I will provide a rubric highlighting my grading standards for this project.</p>
<p>I will require that you identify a general topic for this proposal by Oct 29, and that you submit a draft of this proposal by Nov 12.</p>
</section>
<section id="article-critique" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="article-critique">Article Critique</h2>
<p>You will be tasked with independently finding a piece of empirical, peer-reviewed research in psychology that is interesting and accessible to you. Then I will ask that you critically assess the entire research piece to the best of your ability, critiquing the ethics, validity, design, and conclusions of the study. The full assignment will be discussed more in-depth later in the semester, as it is most appropriate to begin this project after you have demonstrated skills in literature review. However, you may want to begin casually searching for an interesting article early on, as I will ask you get your choice approved by me. I will provide a rubric highlighting my grading standards for this project.</p>
<p>I will require that you are able to locate and provide me with the APA-style citation and full-text PDF of your chosen article. Your choice of article will need to be conveyed to me by Oct 29, and a draft will need to be submitted by Nov 12. Before starting this, you will want to be more familiar with many of the concepts present in the lectures. Later in the semester, we will do in-class article discussions to help prepare you for writing this critique.</p>
</section>
<section id="extra-credit" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="extra-credit">Extra Credit (?)</h2>
<p>At this time, I do not plan on offering any extra credit for this course. <strong>Please do not ask me to offer it and do not plan on it being offered.</strong> <em>If</em> I find an opportunity that I feel will enhance your experience in this course and be eligible for extra credit, I will notify you all through Blackboard. <em>If</em> I do add extra credit assignments, they will supplement the existing points total, rather than adding to the total itself. This means that they will functionally “make up” for lost points on the other assignments.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="schedule" class="level1">
<h1>Schedule</h1>
<p>This schedule will be a rough plan for the semester. In addition to each scheduled quiz/exam and in-class activity, keep in mind I will lecture on the assigned reading for that week. There is the possibility that this schedule will need to change if lectures take longer than expected or if classes are canceled unexpectedly. I will communicate if deadlines change.</p>

<h1>Additional Resources</h1>
<p>Outside myself, the textbook, and course content, there is a wealth of student resources available to you all. While I will always aim to be helpful and available to the best of my ability, I strongly encourage you to utilize these resources to support your learning and accommodation. Unfortunately, I am unable to offer extensive, individualized help to each student and may refer you to one of these services should you request that. Please visit the respective webpages for these services to learn more about what they can offer to you. There are many more than I can list, and you should definitely look at all the available services here: <a href="https://www.gvsu.edu/clas/supporting-students-1136.htm" class="uri">https://www.gvsu.edu/clas/supporting-students-1136.htm</a></p>

<p><strong>Webpage:</strong> <a href="http://www.gvsu.edu/dss" class="uri">http://www.gvsu.edu/dss</a></p>
<p>Any student who requires accommodation because of a physical or learning disability must contact Disability Support Services (DSS; <a href="http://www.gvsu.edu/dss" class="uri">http://www.gvsu.edu/dss</a>) at 616-331-2490 as soon as possible. It is the student’s responsibility to request assistance from DSS. After you have documented your disability, please contact me to set up an appointment or see me during office hours to discuss your specific needs in accordance with your documentation.</p>
<p>Accommodations are always designed to maintain the academic integrity of the course; student with disabilities are held to the same academic standards as all other students. Accordingly, if no additional costs (including staff time) are involved, the instructor will extend such accommodation to anyone who requests them, whether or not the student has a declared disability. If a requested accommodation requires special equipment, space, personnel, staff time, or other resources beyond those normally available to the class, the accommodation will be offered only if the student has gone through the process that begins by declaring the disability with Disability Support Services. If you have a disability and think you might need assistance evacuating the classroom and/or building in an emergency situation, please make sure I am aware, so I can develop a plan to assist you.</p>
<p>Please know that I am committed to making my classroom friendly and accessible to students of all needs and backgrounds. If there is something minor I can do to my presentations and materials to make them more accessible to you, please do let me know.</p>

<section id="faq" class="level1">
<h1>FAQ</h1>
<p><strong>How do you say the professor’s name and how should I address you?</strong></p>
<p>The phonemic spelling is Kwin-tin Kwahg-lee-ah-no. You are welcome to call me Quinton, Prof.&nbsp;Quagliano, or Prof.&nbsp;Q. Please do not address me as Mr.&nbsp;Quagliano (I find it odd) or Dr.&nbsp;Quagliano (I have not earned that honorific).</p>
<p><strong>What is the professor’s background?</strong></p>
<p>I have an B.S. in Psychology (neuroscience concentration) from <a href="https://calvin.edu/">Calvin University</a>, and an M.S. in Quantitative Psychology from <a href="https://www.bsu.edu/">Ball State University</a>. I am a full-time <a href="https://www.napnet.org/what">psychometrist</a> at Trinity Health Grand Rapids in addition to my adjunct role here. Generally, I describe myself as being research-oriented with emphasis on advanced quantitative (statistical) methods. I have had the pleasure on working on projects in a variety of theoretical domains, such as education, neuropsychology, neurology, psychiatry, and audiology. I remain loosely associated with Pine Rest Christian Mental Health Services, Ball State University, and Trinity Health Grand Rapids Neurology/Neuropsychology for ongoing research projects.</p>
<p>I was a TA and tutor for students throughout my undergraduate and graduate education, and have been involved in clinical work (inpatient psychiatry and outpatient neuropsychology) for the last 6 years. My CV will be posted in the course Blackboard if you’d like to know more about me.</p>
<p><strong>Can I talk to the professor about things other than class?</strong></p>
<p>Of course! I love talking about research, careers, your academic journey, and your personal goals. You can always email me or stop by during office hours for a chat. Unfortunately, I cannot offer any research, teaching assistant (TA), or extracurricular opportunities to students at this time, but I can give you pointers on where to look for these things if you are interested! I can serve as a reference or “letter-writer” for your future endeavors, but only if you ask me.</p>
<p><strong>Why so many quizzes?</strong></p>
<p>More assessments mean that a few bad scores won’t sink your chances of a higher letter grade. Constant testing and revisiting of past topics are also excellent ways to learn and solidify concepts. It also lets me know if the class is struggling with certain topics, so I have time to re-hash ideas before the more-important exams. I know it may be stressful to have these every meeting, but I do promise they have a purpose to them. Take good notes revisit topics often and you should be okay.</p>
<p><strong>How can I learn to write better?</strong></p>
<p>One of the best ways to learn how to scholarly write is to constantly read published, scientific articles. I’ve refined my own writing style a lot by just emulating the style of more experienced scientists. Of course, good writing is a skill build up over the course of many years; so be patient and consistent in developing your abilities. I am here to help you prepare your written assignments, but make sure to use the writing center and other resources as well!</p>
<p><strong>Should I drop the course?</strong></p>
<p>I cannot make that decision for you, but I do encourage you to be constantly reflecting upon your success in the course. I try to provide timely feedback and review, so you know how you are performing on things. Sometimes, it is better to drop a course and return when you are more experienced, and there is no shame in doing so. I would suggest you speak with your academic adviser prior to making this decision, so that they can explain any ramifications on your overall degree progress.</p>
<p><strong>Can I re-take or re-submit an assignment, exam, or quiz for a revised score?</strong></p>
<p>No.&nbsp;I give you adequate time, resources, and in-class support to study for quizzes/exams and prepare assignments. I will give constant feedback so that you are better equipped for future assignments, but cannot re-grade revised assignments. I’d like for students to be proactive in creating high-quality work the first time by starting work early and using good study habits.</p>
<p><strong>Why are the article critique and research proposal due before the final exam?</strong></p>
<p>My hope is that, by requiring these due prior to the final exams, you can better focus your efforts at the end of the semester towards studying and preparing for the exam in this course, and your other courses. It also means I can grade these quickly and have your course grade fully updated going into the final. This way, you know where you are at and can get a sense of your ability to aim for a certain letter grade. Because I have due dates for your topics and early drafts of both of these projects, you likely will already have a good start on both ahead of the due dates.</p>

<h1>Tips for Success</h1>
<section id="back-up-your-work" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="back-up-your-work">Back Up Your Work</h2>
<p>We have all been in the undesirable position of losing hours of work due to a sudden power outage or accident. I <strong>strongly</strong> recommend that you use platforms and methods to maintain your work in case of an accident. Use services like Microsoft OneDrive/365 or Google Drive to save your work in the cloud, or use software like git to version control your work. Save regularly and often, enabling auto-save if it is a feature in the software you use. While I empathize with the pain of suddenly losing work, technology issues are not an acceptable excuse for late work - as there are a variety of ways to preemptively protect your progress.</p>
</section>
<section id="stay-organized" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stay-organized">Stay Organized</h2>
<p>The start of the semester is the best time to establish the right organization method that keeps you on track. Losing assignments, papers, and notes to the void can feel like a huge setback. Think critically now about how you want to organize your physical/digital documents, and get it ready now. Stick with it, and you’ll find it much easier to look back later when you need that knowledge! But remember to <a href="#back-up-your-work">Back Up Your Work</a>!</p>
</section>
<section id="create-a-weekly-schedule" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="create-a-weekly-schedule">Create a Weekly Schedule</h2>
<p>While I provide a course <a href="#schedule">Schedule</a> to give structure to the overall class, I would recommend setting up a personal schedule for studying and attending to assignments throughout each week. Procrastinating and trying to rapidly complete work before deadlines will hurt the quality of your work and that will likely be reflected in your grade. Establishing good time-management habits early on in the semester will help you maintain a good balance between your life and classes.</p>
</section>
<section id="communicate-well-with-me" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="communicate-well-with-me">Communicate Well With Me</h2>
<p>I ask that you regularly attend to your email and Blackboard so that you see important notifications from me regarding this course. If you need help or have question please do reach out to me as soon as possible (preferably via email). Ignorance or avoidance of emails and notification is not an excuse for late or poor work. I am always happy to point you in the right direction or clarify something, but I can only do so if you tell me your concerns.</p>
</section>
<section id="take-care-of-yourself" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="take-care-of-yourself">Take Care of Yourself</h2>
<p>Balancing undergraduate studies with the stresses of life is difficult and is a time of change for many students. Make sure you get enough sleep, eat food and drink water, and spend time with friends and family. You’ll do best in my course (and every course) when you are at your best mentally and emotionally! I look forward to supporting you all best I can this term!</p>
