\section{Assignment Instructions}\label{assignment-instructions}

You are to individually write a comprehensive and sophisticated critique
and review of a scientific, peer-reviewed article of your choosing. This
article should be an original, empirical study (i.e., not literature
review or theoretical) somehow related to the field of psychology, and
should use methodology you are at least somewhat familiar with from
content in this course.

You should be mindful to avoid biomedical clinical trial studies (like
those that study prescription drugs) or papers that employ designs that
are especially complex - as you likely won't have the knowledge (yet) to
fully engage with this difficulty. I would also recommend you avoid
animal research, as we have not placed a high emphasis on it this
semester. Finally, you will also want to probably stick to quantitative
research, rather than qualitative. I would encourage you to search for
research in an area that is interesting to you, while also making sure
that you can actually understand the writing.

The core component of this project is all about interrogating the
validity of some research claims, through the clues that we have
discussed this semester. Think of our article discussions in class
(primarily later in the semester). I want you to write about what went
wrong and right in the study \emph{and} make reasonable suggestion on
how it may have been improved. The critique should be thorough and cover
all relevant parts of the study.

APA citations to other literature are not required for your critique,
though you may find it helpful. Do be mindful that if you make a
specific suggestion based off of another piece of literature you MUST
cite it. When you make recommendations, they should be realistic and
practical (i.e., not every study can be a simple random sampling,
double-blind experiment).

If you find you are struggling with writing this, remember GVSU has a
fantastic writing center that can help you out. I am also available to
answer questions if you have any.

This project will consist of 3 parts:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  A submission of your article of interest and a brief summary of the
  study, with the full-text PDF of the paper. You will be expected to
  independently find an article that interests you, using the literature
  review and searching techniques we discuss early in the semester.
  Please read through the entire article before submitting for approval
  to make sure you are comfortable with it. I will review and approve
  your article, before you begin writing, to ensure it is appropriate
  for this project. I will not allow changes to your paper topic after
  the deadline. This will be due by Oct 29. (5 pts)
\item
  A submission of an early draft of your critique. I will expect that
  you have accomplished at least outlining your ideas and general
  thoughts on the validity of the paper. I will give you feedback on
  this draft to make sure you are on the right track for the final work
  and submission. This will be due by Nov 12. (5 pts)
\item
  A final submission of your complete critique. This should address all
  components of the study and discuss the ramifications of both the good
  and bad methodological elements. This will be due by Dec 3. (40 pts)
\end{enumerate}

Please know that I will evaluate you critique based on your knowledge
from this course - I understand that you will not likely understand all
the decisions made by researchers, especially in areas like statistics.
Just try your best to address the things you've learned in this course.

\section{Guiding Questions}\label{guiding-questions}

I will provide a \hyperref[rubric]{Rubric} that outlines the amount of
points for each concept that you are to address. Given that research
methods are very heterogeneous across different papers, journals, and
topics, there are no hard and fast rules for what must be included.
However, I will provide some guiding questions to help you figure out
what to write about. I also want to make sure you address each section
of the paper. Please \textbf{DO NOT} just write responding in bullet
points from these questions - I want to see your thoughtfulness and
creativity as you navigate the paper:

\subsection{Introduction / Literature
Review}\label{introduction-literature-review}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Does the paper cite other appropriate peer reviewed research in
  support of its claims?
\item
  Is there ample citation used to support any and all statements made?
  Does is seem like some statements are lacking supporting evidence?
\item
  Does the paper logically build well to the topic of the paper and
  establish context for the study well?
\item
  Is there a ``gap'' in the research that this study is well-suited to
  address?
\item
  Is there a clear research question and hypothesis made?
\item
  Within the hypothesis, what type of claims are the authors making?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methods}\label{methods}

\emph{In the context of this class, this is likely to be the most
important area to focus on!}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  What measures is the study using? Are these established measures in
  the field, or new tools made for this study? Is there any information
  provided to support the validity and reliability of the measures?
  I.e., what is the measurement reliability and measurement validity of
  this study?
\item
  Do the authors operationalize their research question well? i.e., are
  the methods well-suited to the question asked by the end of
  introduction, is it logical? I.e., what is the construct validity of
  this study?
\item
  Do they explain their sampling procedures and is this sampling
  representative of the population? I.e., what is the external validity
  of this study?
\item
  Do the authors give adequate explanation of any data processes (e.g.,
  missing data, statistics, alpha for significance) that are used?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}\label{results}

\emph{Note: I know you all are not statisticians, just try your best for
this portion}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Does the paper appear to report p-values/confidence intervals and
  effect sizes, and interpret them correctly (i.e., significant or not;
  small, medium, large effect)?
\item
  Does the paper report descriptive statistics on the sample? Does this
  seem like a representative sample based on those values?
\item
  Are the statistical tests presented in a logical order and supportive
  of the research question and methods used?
\item
  Are the statistics appropriate to the scale of measurement of the data
  (e.g., interval, ratio, ordinal, categorical)?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Discussion}\label{discussion}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Are the final conclusions well-supported by the results and methods
  used? Is there strong, or only tentative, evidence for these
  statements?
\item
  Are any potential limitation of the study described and addressed? Do
  the authors provide any suggestions to address these limitations for
  future studies? Are there limitations that are not fully addressed or
  transparently reported by the researchers?
\item
  Do the authors provide any detail for directions in which future
  research could build from this work?
\end{itemize}

\section{Rubric}\label{rubric}

There is no word or page limit or minimum, but please make sure to
include enough content to do justice to the article, while still being
clear and concise. If you have concerns about your length, please reach
